You may get an authorization error, like the following:

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Falta la configuración del dominio</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/installation-guide-webflow-step-5.png" alt="Falta la configuración del dominio" />
</div>

This is because FastComments doesn't know it's supposed to allow your account to be used on this domain.

In this case, the fix is simple. You just have to add your site to your FastComments.com account.

[Go here to add your site to your account.](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/configure-domains)

Now you should have fast, live, commenting added to your site!
