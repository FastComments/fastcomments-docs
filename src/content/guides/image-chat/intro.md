FastComments Image Chat enables interactive discussions on images by allowing users to click anywhere on an image to create discussion points. Users can click on specific parts of images to start conversations about those areas, creating visual markers that show where discussions are located.

This feature is perfect for design feedback, product reviews, educational materials with diagrams, photo galleries with commentary, and any scenario where you want contextual discussions anchored to specific image locations.
