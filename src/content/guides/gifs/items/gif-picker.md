The gif picker by default shows a paginated list of current trending gifs. At the top a search field is displayed, allowing
the user to search for images by one or more terms.

### Gif Providers

Currently, the only integration FastComments supports is with Giphy.

### Gif Anonymization

All assets and API calls from Giphy are stripped of information like cookies and your users' ip address.

### The Gif Content Rating

The content rating of gifs can be customized to be anywhere from `PG` to `R-rated` depending on your audience.
[Documentation for customizing the content rating is here.](/guide-customizations-and-configuration.html#gif-rating)
