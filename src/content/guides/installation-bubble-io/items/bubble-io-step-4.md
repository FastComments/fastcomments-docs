In the Layout tab, set the width to **100%**. This ensures the comment widget takes up the full width of its container and responds properly to different screen sizes.

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Set Width to 100%</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/bubble-io-step-4-set-width-100-percent.png" alt="Setting HTML Element Width to 100%" />
</div>

After changing the input value to `100` (or the desired percentage) you'll have to click the dropdown next to the number to change it from
pixels to percentage.

Also, set a minimum height (e.g., 400px) to ensure the comment widget has enough space to display properly.

After making these changes, click the **Preview** button to see your FastComments widget in action!
