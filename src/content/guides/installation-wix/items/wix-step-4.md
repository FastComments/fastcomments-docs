Now that we have the comment widget added, let's get it arranged on our page.

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Step 4: Resize</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/installation-guide-wix-step-4-resize.png" alt="Step 3: Resize" />
</div>

With this tutorial we will be able to change the current thread based on the active page. However, we won't be able to resize the comment widget dynamically
until Wix opens up this functionality. Until then, you will have to decide how big you'd like the comment area on your page and size it appropriately.
