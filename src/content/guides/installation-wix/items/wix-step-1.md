For this example, we're going to add FastComments Live Commenting to blog post pages.

To do this, we'll open our site in the Wix editor.

Then, we'll need to make sure we're editing the right page.

We want to make sure that we show a unique comment thread for each blog post, so let's edit `Blog Pages -> Post`.

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Step One: Edit The Dynamic Post Page</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/installation-guide-wix-step-1-open-page.png" alt="Edit The Dynamic Post Page" />
</div>
