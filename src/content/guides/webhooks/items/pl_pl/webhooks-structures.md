The only structure sent via webhooks is the WebhookComment object, outlined in TypeScript below.

#### Struktura obiektu WebhookComment

##### Struktura zdarzenia „Create”
The "create" event request body is a WebhookComment object.

##### Struktura zdarzenia „Update”
The "update" event request body is a WebhookComment object.

##### Struktura zdarzenia „Delete”
The "delete" event request body is a WebhookComment object.

    Change as of Nov 14th 2023
    Previously the "delete" event request body only contained the comment id. It now contains the full comment at the time of deletion.

Every key is always present in the body. When the comment has no value for a field the body carries `null`
(or `false` for booleans and `[]` for lists), so the shape of a delivery never varies from one comment to the next.

    /** The id of the comment. **/

When users are tagged in a comment, the information is stored in a list called `mentions`. Each object in that list
has the following structure.

[inline-code-attrs-start title = 'Obiekt Wzmianki Webhook'; type = 'typescript'; inline-code-attrs-end]
[inline-code-start]
interface CommentUserMention {
    /** The user id. For SSO users, this will have your tenant id prefixed. **/
    id: string
    /** The final @mention tag text, including the @ symbol. **/
    tag: string
    /** The original @mention tag text, including the @ symbol. **/
    rawTag: string
    /** What type of user was tagged. user = FastComments.com account. sso = SSOUser. **/
    type: 'user'|'sso'
    /** If the user opts out of notifications, this will still be set to true. **/
    sent: boolean
}

#### Metody HTTP

You can configure the HTTP method for each webhook event type in the admin panel:

- **Zdarzenie Create**: POST or PUT (default: PUT)
- **Zdarzenie Update**: POST or PUT (default: PUT)
- **Zdarzenie Delete**: DELETE, POST, or PUT (default: DELETE)

Since all requests contain an ID, Create and Update operations are idempotent by default (PUT). Repeating the same Create or Update request should not create duplicate objects on your side.

#### Nagłówki żądania

Each webhook request includes the following headers:

| Nagłówek | Opis |
|--------|-------------|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |
| `token` | Your API Secret |
| `X-FastComments-Timestamp` | Unix timestamp (seconds) when the request was signed |
| `X-FastComments-Signature` | HMAC-SHA256 signature (`sha256=<hex>`) |

See [Security & API Tokens](/guide-webhooks.html#webhooks-api-tokens) for information on verifying the HMAC signature.
