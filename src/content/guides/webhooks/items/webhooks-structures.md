The only structure sent via webhooks is the WebhookComment object, outlined in TypeScript below.

#### The WebhookComment Object Structure

##### The "Create" Event Structure
The "create" event request body is a WebhookComment object.

##### The "Update" Event Structure
The "update" event request body is a WebhookComment object.

##### The "Delete" Event Structure
The "delete" event request body is a WebhookComment object, but only containing the id.

When users are tagged in a comment, the information is stored in a list called `mentions`. Each object in that list
has the following structure.

[inline-code-attrs-start title = 'The Webhook Mentions Object'; type = 'typescript'; inline-code-attrs-end]
[inline-code-start]
interface CommentUserMention {
    /** The user id. For SSO users, this will have your tenant id prefixed. **/
    id: string
    /** The final @mention tag text, including the @ symbol. **/
    tag: string
    /** The original @mention tag text, including the @ symbol. **/
    rawTag: string
    /** What type of user was tagged. user = FastComments.com account. sso = SSOUser. **/
    type: 'user'|'sso'
    /** If the user opts out of notifications, this will still be set to true. **/
    sent: boolean
}

#### HTTP Methods Used

**Create and Update both use HTTP PUT and not POST!**

Since all of our requests contain an ID, repeating the same Create or Update request should not create new objects on your side.

This means that these calls are idempotent and should be PUT events as per the HTTP specification.
