The VanillaJS version of the widget is the simplest way to add comments to your website, not requiring any build systems or server-side code.

Simply add the following code snippet to any page to add comments to your site:

[code-example-start config = {}; title = 'Simple Code Snippet'; code-example-end]

You can use the same code snippet on multiple pages; it will automatically create a separate thread for each page.

Many applications have an "HTML Embed Code" option. Select that and paste the code snippet above into it.

*You also don't need an account to try it!* You might see "tenantId: demo" in the snippet above if you're not logged in. That way it will use
the demo account.

You can find documentation on configuring the widget <a href="/guide-customizations-and-configuration.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

All versions of the FastComments widget are wrappers around the core VanillaJS library. This allows us to add features
and fix issues in one place - and the changes automatically propagate to the other variants of the commenting widget.
