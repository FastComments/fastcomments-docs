All versions of the FastComments widget are wrappers around the core VanillaJS library. This allows us to add features
and fix issues in one place - and the changes automatically propagate to the other variants of the commenting widget.

The VanillaJS version of the widget is very easy to install, not requiring any build systems or server side code.

Simply add the following code snippet to any page:

[code-example-start config = {}; title = 'Installation Example'; code-example-end]

You can find documentation on configuring it <a href="/guide-customizations-and-configuration.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
