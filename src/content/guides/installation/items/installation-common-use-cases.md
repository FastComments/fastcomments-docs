### Showing Live Comments Right Away

The comment widget is live by default, however live comments appear under a "Show N New Comments" button to prevent
the page content from moving around.

In some cases, it's still desirable to show the new comments right away, without having to click a button.

In this case, you want to enable the `showLiveRightAway` flag, which you can find documentation for [here](/guide-customizations-and-configuration.html#show-live-right-away).

### Allowing Anonymous Commenting (Not Requiring Email)

By default, FastComments requires the user to leave an email when they comment.

This can be disabled, [instructions are here](/guide-customizations-and-configuration.html#allow-anon).

### Custom Styling

Many of our customers apply their own styling to the comment widget. You can find the documentation [here](/guide-customizations-and-configuration.html#custom-css).
