When sharing code snippets, FastComments does its best to automatically determine which
programming language the code snippet is in to automatically format and apply syntax highlighting.

FastComments syntax highlighting currently supports 39 common languages:

- .properties
- Apache
- config
- Bash
- C
- C#
- C++
- CSS
- CoffeeScript
- Diff
- Go
- HTML, XML
- HTTP
- JSON
- Java
- JavaScript
- Kotlin
- Less
- Lua
- Makefile
- Markdown
- Nginx
- config
- Objective-C
- PHP
- PHP Template
- Perl
- Plain text
- Python
- Python REPL
- R
- Ruby
- Rust
- SCSS
- SQL
- Shell
- Session
- Swift
- TOML and INI
- TypeScript
- Visual Basic .NET
- YAML

When sharing a code snippet in a language we don't support, it will still be rendered like code -
but no syntax highlighting or reformatting will be applied.
