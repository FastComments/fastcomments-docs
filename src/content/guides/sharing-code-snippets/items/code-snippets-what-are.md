Code snippets are small pieces of code, hence "snippets" of code, that can be shared while commenting.

With FastComments, simply pasting a snippet of code should automatically be detected and formatted.

When commenting, the code snippet will be wrapped in `<code>` blocks, and the formatting happens
after you submit your comment.

The wrapping in `<code>` blocks is automatic when pasting a snippet of code, in many languages.

Alternatively, you can highlight a piece of text and click the `Code` button in the toolbar.
