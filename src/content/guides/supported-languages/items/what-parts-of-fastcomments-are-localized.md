All FastComments products that are **embeddable in your application or website**, are localized.

All **emails** are fully localized. The locale used to render the emails we send are based on the last
locale the user used when they last logged in or commented with the commenting widget.

The **admin and user dashboard** is not currently localized, however it is on the roadmap.
