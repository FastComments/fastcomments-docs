The next step is going to be adding the widget code that makes the integration work.

Once you are in the theme editor, as directed from the previous step, you'll see a file browser on the left and an editor on the right.

What we are going to do is edit a *template* that represents our blog post pages.

In the left-hand navigation, go to `templates->pages->blog-post.html`.

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Open The Template</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/bigcommerce-step-2-open-blog-post-template.png" alt="Open The Template" />
</div>
