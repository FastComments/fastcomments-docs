The next step is to add the widget code that makes the integration work.

Once you're in the theme editor, as directed in the previous step, you'll see a file browser on the left and an editor on the right.

We will edit a *template* that represents our blog post pages.

In the left-hand navigation, go to `templates->pages->blog-post.html`.

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Open The Template</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/bigcommerce-step-2-open-blog-post-template.png" alt="Open The Template" />
</div>
