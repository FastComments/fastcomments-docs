Due to the design of ThriveCart Learn+, we have to add the FastComments code to every course page we want to display comments on.

We can use the same code snippet on every page, and separate comment threads will automatically be tied to each individual page.

We'll start by opening our course in the editor and adding an HTML block.

On the left you should see an HTML block option. Drag that into the page where you want to display comments.

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Open Course and Add HTML Block</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/thrivecart-learn-step-1-1-add-html-block.png" alt="Open Course and Add HTML Block" />
</div>

Now select the new HTML element. A block will appear on the left where we can paste our code.

Now you're ready for Step 2.
