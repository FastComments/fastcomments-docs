Any metrics that you may be rate limited or billed for are reported on in the [Billing Analytics Page](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/analytics/billing).

Some example metrics that are tracked:

- Page Loads (for the current month)
- API Credits (for the current month)
- New Comments Stored (for the current month)
- Tenant Users
- SSO Users
- Moderators
- Domains

For the `Creators` and `Pro` plans, these metrics simply serve as a guide to know if you are close to or have hit the limits of your account.

For the `Flex` plan, this page will show a cost breakdown of current usage for the **next** invoice. This makes it easy to understand how you
will be billed before it happens. You can see past invoices in [Billing History](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/billing-history).

The metrics `Page Loads`, `API Credits`, and `New Comments Stored` may be up to one minute out of date. The other metrics are realtime.

This information is stored on a monthly basis for one year, or until you delete your tenant, for historical purposes, but the UI will only show the current period.
