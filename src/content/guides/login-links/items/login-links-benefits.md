The first and foremost benefit to Login Links is decreased friction.

#### For Commenters

Users commenting on your website can create an account quicker, since they do not have to
provide a password. If you have the email input field configured to show when commenting, and the user
provides an email, we will automatically create an account and send them a welcome email.

**Note! It may be required by your jurisdiction to let the user know that their email is shared
with a third party. At a minimum, cover this in your privacy policy.**

Other benefits are that for some events, we can send the commenter a link to take action, which
automatically authenticates them.

#### For Tenant Admins & Moderators

The benefits for tenant admins and moderators are very similar to commenters, including reduced
friction when signing up for FastComments and adding users to your tenant. Additionally, for those
not using a password manager - it is one less thing to remember.

For notifications and emails that require action, like:

- Tenant Digest
- Comment Notifications

The links in these emails are temporary magic links.
