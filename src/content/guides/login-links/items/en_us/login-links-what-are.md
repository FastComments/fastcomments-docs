Login Links, also commonly called Magic Links, are links which, when accessed, give you access
to some set of information. In the case of FastComments, these links are used for authentication.

They are commonly called "Magic Links" because it seems like magic - you click a link in your email, and you are automatically, and securely, logged in.
