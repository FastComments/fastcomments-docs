All FastComments users can be sent login links. These links only authenticate for the scope the user has access to. If the user is a commenter, they will never be granted admin permissions from a login link.

Additionally, admins can send any tenant user a new login link from the [users page](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/users).
