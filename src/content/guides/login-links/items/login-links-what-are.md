Login Links, also commonly called Magic Links, are links where, upon accessing, give you access
to some set of information. In the case of FastComments, these links are used for authentication.

They are commonly called "Magic Links" since it seems like magic - you click a link in your email, and you are automatically, and securely, logged in.
