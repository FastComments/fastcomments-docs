## Login Links

FastComments aims to make its user experience as straight forward as possible.

Login Links are one of many mechanisms we used to achieve this goal.

As of late 2023 FastComments also supports traditional password-based authentication.

As of 2025 FastComments also supports two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced security.
