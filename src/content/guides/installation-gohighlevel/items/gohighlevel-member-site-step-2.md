Next, we need to open the `Advanced` settings:

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Open Advanced Settings</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/gohighlevel-step-2-open-advanced.png" alt="Open Advanced Settings" />
</div>

We'll be adding our code to the `Tracking Code` section. Go to that section and click `Footer Code`.
