`@mentions` autocomplete works by autocompleting usernames from various sources.

The users shown in the autocompleted list are determined by:

- Users who have commented on the same page or thread.
- Users who have created their FastComments accounts through the same site.
- Moderators of the current site.
- SSO users who belong to the current tenant.
