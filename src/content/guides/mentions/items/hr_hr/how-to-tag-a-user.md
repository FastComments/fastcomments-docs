When writing, or editing, a comment, simply type the `@` symbol, and the start of the user's name.

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="https://blog.fastcomments.com/images/fc-mentions.png" alt="Primjer spominjanja" title="Primjer spominjanja" />
</div>

Simply click the user's name you wish to tag.

Additionally, you can use the up and down arrow keys to navigate this list, and hit enter to select, or escape to leave.

We know that you may want to use the `@` symbol without tagging a user. FastComments will detect this and not intrude on your typing experience.

Note that autocomplete first prefers case-sensitive matches, and then will also attempt to search for case-insensitive results.
