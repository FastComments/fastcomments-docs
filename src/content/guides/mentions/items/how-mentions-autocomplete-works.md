`@mentions` autocomplete works by autocompleting user-names from various sources.

The users shown in the autocompleted list is determined by:

- Users that have commented on the same page or thread.
- Users that have created their FastComments accounts through the same site.
- Moderators of the current site.
- SSO users that belong to the current tenant.
