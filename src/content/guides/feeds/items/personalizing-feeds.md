FastComments Feeds can be personalized to show relevant content to different users through the use of tags. Tags provide a flexible way to categorize and filter posts, allowing you to create customized feed experiences.

### How Tags Work

Tags are applied when creating posts and can be used when fetching posts to filter the content. This approach allows you to build targeted feeds that display only the content relevant to specific audiences or interests.

### Using Tags for Personalization

When creating posts, you can assign tags that represent different categories, interests, user segments, or any other criteria relevant to your application. These tags then serve as filters when users fetch their personalized feeds.

For example, you might use tags to:
- Show content based on user interests (sports, technology, entertainment)
- Display posts relevant to specific user roles or permissions
- Filter content by topic categories
- Target content to specific user groups

### Tag-Based Feed Filtering

When fetching posts for a feed, you can specify which tags to include. This allows each user to see a personalized view of the feed content based on their preferences, permissions, or profile characteristics.

The flexibility of the tagging system means you can implement sophisticated personalization logic while keeping the feed management simple and maintainable.

### Cross-Platform Consistency

The same tagging approach works consistently across web, native Android, and iOS implementations, ensuring your personalization strategy remains consistent regardless of the platform your users are accessing the feed from.
