First, make sure you have some blog posts added to your site to see the results of this tutorial.

Once ready, we can go ahead and open the Weebly editor, and click `Settings` at the top.

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">設定を開く</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/weebly-step-1-1-open-settings.png" alt="設定を開く" />
</div>

Now let's open the settings for our blog by going to `Blog` on the left:

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">ブログ設定を開く</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/weebly-step-1-2-open-blog-settings.png" alt="ブログ設定を開く" />
</div>

Now what we need to do is disable the default Weebly comment system, which we will replace.

**Note** if you'd like to migrate over existing comments from your Weebly site to FastComments, your support representative can assist with this migration.

Now let's set the `Commenting system` to `Default` and `Comment Default` to `Closed`:

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">デフォルトシステムを無効にする</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/weebly-step-1-3-disable-default.png" alt="デフォルトシステムを無効にする" />
</div>

Next we just have to add the FastComments.com widget code!
