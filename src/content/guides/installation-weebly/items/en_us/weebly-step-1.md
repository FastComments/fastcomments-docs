First, make sure you have some blog posts added to your site to see the results of this tutorial.

Once ready, we can go ahead and open the Weebly editor, and click `Settings` at the top.

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Open Settings</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/weebly-step-1-1-open-settings.png" alt="Open Settings" />
</div>

Now let's open the settings for our blog by going to `Blog` on the left:

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Open Blog Settings</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/weebly-step-1-2-open-blog-settings.png" alt="Open Blog Settings" />
</div>

Now we need to disable the default Weebly comment system, which we will replace.

**Note** if you'd like to migrate over existing comments from your Weebly site to FastComments, your support representative can assist with this migration.

Now let's set the `Commenting system` to `Default` and `Comment Default` to `Closed`:

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Disable The Default System</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/weebly-step-1-3-disable-default.png" alt="Disable The Default System" />
</div>

Next we just have to add the FastComments.com widget code!
