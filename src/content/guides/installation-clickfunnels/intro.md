In this tutorial we'll cover setting up FastComments [Streaming Chat](https://fastcomments.com/product/live-chat) with a ClickFunnels course. We'll also add 
a code snippet at the end for [Live Commenting](https://fastcomments.com/demo) if you want to use that instead.

Note that this tutorial is for a Course module but the steps are similar for adding commenting to blog posts and pages (simply edit the corresponding template).

We will also briefly cover setting up automated comments to help encourage people to engage.
