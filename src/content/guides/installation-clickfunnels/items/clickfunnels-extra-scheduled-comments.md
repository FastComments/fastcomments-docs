FastComments supports something called Auto Play. This allows you to import a CSV of comments and schedule them to play
at certain offsets based on hour, minute, and seconds from page load time.

It also automatically adds any comments posted back into the autoplay script, at the correct time, so that your video
script grows with each webinar without any manual work.

This is currently included in all FastComments plans.

### Note!

Remember that the `URL ID` column in the CSV file must match the `URL` of the course/video.
