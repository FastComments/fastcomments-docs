When moderating, sometimes there is a series of actions that we want to take all at once. For example maybe you find a
series of comments you want to delete, mark as spam, un-approve, or simply mark as reviewed. Instead of clicking "delete" and "confirm"
on each comment, there's a better way.

Next to each comment is a checkbox, which we can click to start a bulk action. From there we can pick a bulk action and confirm it.

You will see the progress as your bulk actions are taken, and you can ctrl+z to undo any bulk action. Bulk actions can also
be paused, stopped, or resumed.

### Selecting Beyond Visible Comments

If you select the "Select All" checkbox it'll by default only select the visible comments on the page, but it will
present you with an option to select all comments on the server that match your filters. So even if you need to approve, delete, etc
millions of comments, you can do it with a few clicks.
