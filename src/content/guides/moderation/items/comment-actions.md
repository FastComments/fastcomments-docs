With FastComments, there are a number of actions that Admins and Moderators can take on each comment, namely:

- **Deleting** that comment
- **Delete** that comment + **Ban the user** (Permanent or Shadow, more details later)
- **Edit** that comment
- **Adjust the votes** of that comment
- Mark that comment **Reviewed** or **Not Reviewed**
- Mark that comment **Approved** or **Not Approved**
- Mark that comment as **Spam** or **Not Spam**

For example, to keep a comment around but hide it, we can simply mark it as **Not Approved**.

Additionally, Admins and Moderators can pin comments, but this can only be done from the comment thread itself.
