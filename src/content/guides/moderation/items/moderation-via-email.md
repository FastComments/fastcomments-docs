While including overall statistics around your comments, it will also list the three most recent comments needing review.

For each of said comments, direct magic links are provided to:
- Approve the comment.
- Mark the comment reviewed and go to the respond page.
- Mark the comment as spam.

These links for each comment will automatically authenticate you and take the action from your email.

Additionally, a Moderate Comments button is located in the Digest which will perform the same authentication and take you to
the Moderate Comments page.

Please note that these magic links do expire after some time.
