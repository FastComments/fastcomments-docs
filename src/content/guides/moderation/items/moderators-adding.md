For administrators, at the top of the Comment Moderation page is an Add Moderators button.

[app-screenshot-start url='/auth/my-account/moderate-comments?filter=&text-search=&page=1&count=3&demo=true'; selector = '.moderation-settings-options'; title='Comment Moderation Setting Buttons' app-screenshot-end]

If you already have moderators, this button will say "Edit Moderators".

Let's take a look at the "Add a Moderator" page.

[app-screenshot-start url='/auth/my-account/moderate-comments/moderator/new'; selector = '.account-block'; title='The Add a Moderator Page' app-screenshot-end]

To add a moderator all that is needed is a name and an email.

If the email is associated with an existing FastComments account, they will be invited via email to join your account as a moderator.

If the given email is not associated with an existing FastComments account, a new one will be created for them.

An invite link will be sent to the moderator, which can automatically log them in. In the future if they wish to login, they can simply visit the
<a href="https://fastcomments.com/auth/login" target="_blank">login page</a> and enter the name/email that you provided earlier. This will send them
a link to login.

Unless they log out, they will be logged in for thirty days.
