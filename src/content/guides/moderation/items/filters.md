By default, the moderation page shows all comments, but we can filter comments in many ways:

- By Comments Needing Review
- By Comments Needing Approval
- By Comments Flagged as Spam
- By Comments Already Reviewed
- By Comments Approved

## Reviewed vs Approved

With FastComments, only approved comments will ever be able to show. This does not mean that you need to manually approve every comment,
as is the setting by default. That can be configured <a href="https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/moderate-comments/settings" target="_blank">here</a>.

So, Approved means the comment can be viewed by other users on your site.

Reviewed is simply a tool for administrators and moderators, and has no impact on the visibility of a comment.

The Reviewed flag makes it easier to find comments that you have reviewed.
