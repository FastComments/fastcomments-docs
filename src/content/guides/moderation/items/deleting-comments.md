There are a few things to consider when removing comments.

1. What the user that originally wrote the comment sees.
2. What happens to any replies of that comment.

When you delete a comment, that comment is also gone for the user that wrote it originally.

Additionally, that comment is removed from the screens of any users reading that comment.

If this comment has replies, and replies of those replies, they will be immediately deleted as well. Parent comments in the thread are retained.
