The place where most moderation takes place is the Comment Moderation page. For example, here's a screenshot of our current demo account:

[app-screenshot-start url='/auth/my-account/moderate-comments?filter=&text-search=&page=1&count=3&demo=true'; selector = '.content'; title='Comment Moderation Page' app-screenshot-end]

We've set the count per page to three to make this screenshot a reasonable size. In practice, you would be working with 50 comments per page by default.

Let's go into the features shown here.
