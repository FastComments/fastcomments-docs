A subset of moderation actions can be taken directly from the comment thread itself, without having to go to the Comment Moderation page.

When you are logged in, click the edit button in the top right of a comment. You should have the following options as
a moderator:

- **Pin** that comment
- **Delete** that comment
- **Delete** that comment + **Ban the user** (Permanent or Shadow, more details later)
- **Edit** that comment
- Mark that comment **Approved** (show it) or **Not Approved** (hide it)
- Mark that comment as **Spam** or **Not Spam**

### Updated Live

All of these actions will update the comment threads of other users right away without them having to
reload the page. However, the moderator actions like hiding a comment or marking it as spam, do not
remove the comment from **the moderator's** screen so that if needed they can quickly undo the action. To indicate that comment
is hidden it will be highlighted in comparison to the other comments (the highlighting color depending on the reason for removal).

For example, given users `A (commenter)`, `B (Moderator 1)`, and `C (Moderator 2)`.

...and the following scenario:

1. `User B (Moderator 1)` hides a comment.
2. For `User A (commenter)` that comment is immediately hidden.
3. For `User C (Moderator 2)` that comment is immediately hidden.
4. For the user that made the change, `User B (Moderator 1)`, the comment remains on their screen, but is highlighted as removed. They have the option to undo their action, in which case the other users will see the update, live, again.
