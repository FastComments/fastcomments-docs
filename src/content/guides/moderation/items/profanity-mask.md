By default, FastComments comes with a word blacklist of ~450 phrases and words.

If text in the word blacklist is found in a new comment that text will be replaced with asterisks (***).

The page to customize the blacklist can be found via Moderate Comments -> Edit Moderation Settings -> Edit Word Blacklist, or
by going directly <a href="https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/moderate-comments/blacklist" target="_blank">here</a>.

[app-screenshot-start url='/auth/my-account/moderate-comments/blacklist?blurList=true'; linkUrl='/auth/my-account/moderate-comments/blacklist'; selector = '.account-block'; title='Comment Word Blacklist' app-screenshot-end]

Additionally, you can disable Profanity Detection on the <a href="https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/moderate-comments/settings" target="_blank">Edit Moderation Settings</a> page.
