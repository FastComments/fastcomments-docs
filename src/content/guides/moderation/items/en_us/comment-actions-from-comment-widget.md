A subset of moderation actions can be taken directly from the comment thread itself, without having to go to the Comment Moderation page.

When you are logged in, click the edit button in the top right of a comment. You should have the following options as
a moderator:

- **Pin** that comment
- **Delete** that comment
- **Delete** that comment + **Ban the user** (Permanent or Shadow, more details later)
- **Edit** that comment
- Mark that comment **Approved** (show it) or **Not Approved** (hide it)
- Mark that comment as **Spam** or **Not Spam**

### Closing Comment Threads

Moderators and administrators can lock, or close, comment threads, by selecting `Close Thread` in the three-dot menu in the top
of the comment area, if they are logged in. They can select `Re-Open Thread` later, at any time, to re-open commenting.

Closing a comment thread prevents new comments, but still allows voting, and for users to delete their comments if desired.

Closing and reopening comment threads instantly affects all users viewing the thread.

You can also mark a thread read-only, which removes vote and delete options as well, by creating a customization rule specifically for that page.

### Updated Live

All of these actions will update the comment threads of other users right away without them having to
reload the page. However, the moderator actions like hiding a comment or marking it as spam, do not
remove the comment from **the moderator's** screen so that if needed they can quickly undo the action. To indicate that the comment
is hidden, it will be highlighted in comparison to the other comments (the highlighting color depending on the reason for removal).

For example, given users `A (commenter)`, `B (Moderator 1)`, and `C (Moderator 2)`.

...and the following scenario:

1. `User B (Moderator 1)` hides a comment.
2. For `User A (commenter)` that comment is immediately hidden.
3. For `User C (Moderator 2)` that comment is immediately hidden.
4. For the user that made the change, `User B (Moderator 1)`, the comment remains on their screen, but is highlighted as removed. They have the option to undo their action, in which case the other users will see the update, live, again.
