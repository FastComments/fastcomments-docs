Moderators are special users who only have access to the Moderate Comments page of your FastComments account.

They cannot add or remove other moderators or edit moderation settings. They do, however, have full control over the comment data
shown in the Moderate Comments page and can take all actions that an admin can on an individual comment basis. They can also
execute bulk actions.

They do not have access to the data management tools (importing/exporting/migrating comments).
