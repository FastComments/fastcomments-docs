By default, the moderation page shows all comments, but we can filter comments in many ways:

- Needing Review
- Needing Approval
- Flagged as Spam
- Flagged as Not Spam
- Flagged
- Already Reviewed
- Approved
- From Banned Users

## Reviewed vs Approved

With FastComments, only approved comments will ever be able to show. This does not mean that you need to manually approve every comment.
By default, comments are automatically approved. This can be configured <a href="https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/moderate-comments/settings" target="_blank">here</a>.

So, Approved means the comment can be viewed by other users on your site.

Reviewed is simply a tool for administrators and moderators, and has no impact on the visibility of a comment.

The Reviewed flag makes it easier to find comments that you have reviewed.
