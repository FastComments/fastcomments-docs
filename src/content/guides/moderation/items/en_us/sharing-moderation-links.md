With FastComments, it's possible for moderators to share links to the moderator dashboard that go directly to a certain page with some filters.

For example, the following use case:

- Moderator A goes to the Comment Moderation dashboard
- Moderator A filters by Comments Needing Review
- Moderator A searches for a comment with the text "My Company Name"
- Moderator A finds something interesting on the second page of the resulting searched comments.
- Moderator A can **share the link** of this page directly with Moderator B.
- Moderator B can see what Moderator A did.
