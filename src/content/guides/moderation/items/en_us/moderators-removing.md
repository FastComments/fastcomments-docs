To remove a moderator, on the Edit Moderators page, simply click "delete".

They will immediately lose access to moderating your comments, and will receive an email notifying them
that they have been removed.

Note that if you only want to update their email, you can do that by clicking "edit". This is preferred as
their statistics won't be erased.
