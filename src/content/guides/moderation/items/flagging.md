With FastComments, users can flag comments which increases an internal count associated with that comment.

Moderators can view flagged comments, and the comment's corresponding Flag Count, via the Moderate Comments page by using the Flagged filter.

### Auto Hide Flagged Comments

Comments can be hidden based on the number of times they are flagged. This threshold can be configured under the [Comment Moderation Settings](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/moderate-comments/settings) page.

See the "Automatically Un-Approve Flagged Comments" setting.

For example, with a threshold of 5, the comment will be un-approved and hidden after it is flagged by five users.

### Un-Flagging Comments

From the Comment Moderation page, moderators can un-flag comments which resets the flag count associated with that comment.

If the comment was hidden due to the number of times it was flagged, then un-flagging will cause the comment to re-appear.

Re-Approving a comment that was un-approved (hidden) due to being flagged, will also reset the flag count associated with that comment.
