First, we're going to add a contact form that FastComments will replace.

To do this, open the site editor, and click `Add Section` on the desired page.

Then, go to `Content -> Contact -> Contact Form` on the left, as shown:

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Add Contact Form</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/ionos-step-1-add-contact-section.png" alt="Add Contact Form" />
</div>

Next, we need to tell FastComments to replace our form. Click on the default form title:

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Set Form Title</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/ionos-step-1-change-title.png" alt="Set Form Title" />
</div>

We'll set the title to `FastComments Goes Here`. It's very important that the casing
and spacing match exactly; otherwise it won't work, so we recommend you copy and paste this text.

When done, it should appear as follows:

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Done Setting Title</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/ionos-step-1-add-contact-section-done.png" alt="Done Setting Title" />
</div>

That's the end of step one!
