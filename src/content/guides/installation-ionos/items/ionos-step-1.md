First, we're going to add a contact form which FastComments will replace.

To do this, open the site editor, and click `Add Section` on the desired page.

Then, go to `Content -> Contact -> Contact Form` on the left, as shown:

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Add Contact Form</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/ionos-step-1-add-contact-section.png" alt="Add Contact Form" />
</div>

Next, we need to tell FastComments to replace our form. Click on the default form title:

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Set Form Title</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/ionos-step-1-change-title.png" alt="Set Form Title" />
</div>

We'll set the title to `FastComments Goes Here`. It's very important that the casing
and spacing is the same, or else it won't work, so we recommend you copy this text and paste it in.

When done, it should appear as follows:

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Done Setting Title</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/ionos-step-1-add-contact-section-done.png" alt="Done Setting Title" />
</div>

That's the end of step one!
