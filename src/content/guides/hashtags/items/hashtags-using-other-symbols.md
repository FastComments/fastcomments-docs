Upon request, symbols other than `#` can be used.

Different tag symbols can be used to link to different pieces of content. For example, the API could be used to define hashtags with the `#` symbol
as topic items, but also define entries such as `~document_one` and `~document_two`. In this scenario, users could use hashtags as well as custom tags
to point to other documents.
