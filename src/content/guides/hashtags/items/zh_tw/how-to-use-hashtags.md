#### 填充自動完成

HashTags can be populated in two ways.

First, by default users can type the `#` symbol and some text - and if there are existing hashtags an autocomplete UI will be shown.

If a user enters new hashtag, [除非已停用](/guide-customizations-and-configuration.html#disable-automatic-hashtag-creation), the hashtag
will automatically be created and highlighted.

The second way is to manually define each hashtag. This is covered in this document.

#### 使用情境

HashTags are useful for members of the community to navigate to find relevant discussions. They are also useful to tag relevant
pieces of information, as links, which can be defined via our API. For example, hashtags could be used to tag:

- Tickets in a ticketing system.
- Documents or Pages in CRM.
- Files.
