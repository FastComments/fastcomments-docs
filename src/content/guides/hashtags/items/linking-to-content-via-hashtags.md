By default, clicking a hashtag opens a view with a list of comments with the hashtag. However, we can change this to link to an
external piece of content for each hashtag.

This can be done when adding hashtags [via the API](/guide-api.html#hash-tag-structure). When we add a hashtag via the API it is possible
to define a URL for each tag.
