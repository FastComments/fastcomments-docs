By default, FastComments lets your users create hashtags, building the hashtag list and adding to autocomplete over time.

Banned users cannot add new hashtags even if automatic hashtag creation is enabled.

However, it is possible to pre-define the set of hashtags [via the API](/guide-api.html#hash-tag-structure). Note that if adding many hashtags, there
is a bulk-add API available.

Pre-Populated and Automatically-Created hashtags contribute to the same dataset and both will end up in the hashtag autocomplete.
