When hashtags are added via the API, or when users enter new hashtags, they are added to a central data store.

Upon entering a trigger keyword (`#` is the default) followed by a character, the system begins searching for relevant hashtags
that start with the same text and displays them as suggestions. These results are sorted alphabetically.

The same applies to `@mentions`; you can use the keyboard to select an item from the autocomplete menu.
