When hashtags are added via the API, or when users enter new hashtags, they are added to a central datastore.

Upon entering a trigger keyword (`#` is the default), and a character, the system will begin searching for relevant hashtags
that start with the same text and show them as suggestions. These results are sorted alphabetically.

Same with `@mentions`, the keyboard can be used to select an item from the autocomplete menu.
