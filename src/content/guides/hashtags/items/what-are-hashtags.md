FastComments #hashtags provide a way for a user to tag their comment as relevant to a particular topic or group. Additionally, hashtags
can be used to link to other pages or documents.

For example, if desired, a customer hosting an online video review site could pre-populate a hashtag for each video, and define each hashtag
as linking to the appropriate review page for that video. In this way, when someone clicks on `#awesomevideo` in a comment, they go to `https://example.com/awesome-video/reviews`
instead of viewing all comments with the `#awesomevideo` tag.
