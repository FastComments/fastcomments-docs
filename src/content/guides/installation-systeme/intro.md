With FastComments we can easily add live commenting to any Systeme.io blog.

The instructions below are for a blog built on Systeme.io, but the embed code can also be manually added to any page by editing other theme files. FastComments Support can also assist with this.

Note that this tutorial requires a FastComments account. It's recommended that you sign up first and then come back here. [You can create an account here.](https://fastcomments.com/auth/tenant-signup?packageId=flex)
