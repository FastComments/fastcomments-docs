We can improve the widget's positioning by doing two things.

First, on the left pane, set the widget's height to `fill` and `1fr`:

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Comment Widget Height</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/framer-step-4-widget-height.png" alt="Comment Widget Height" />
</div>

Next we need to fix the default Framer page config. By default it sets the page height to a fixed size, which can cut off
comment threads. So let's set this to `fill`, too.

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Set Page Height</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/framer-step-4-page-height.png" alt="Set Page Height" />
</div>

You may have to play with the page height to get it how you want it.
