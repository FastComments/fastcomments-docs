이제 `Embed` 블록을 추가해 보겠습니다.

Go to `Insert` in the top left:

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Insert를 클릭하세요</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/framer-step-2-click-insert.png" alt="Click Insert" />
</div>

Then scroll the left hand sidebar down and mouse over `Utility`.

Next you'll want to *click and drag* the `Utility` block to the end of your blog.

It's important you *click and drag* as shown, and not just click it. If you just click it, then Framer will insert it
outside of your blog and you'll have to drag it around later.

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Embed 위젯 찾기</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/framer-step-2-insert-embed.png" alt="Locate Embed Widget" />
</div>

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Embed 위젯 드래그 앤 드롭</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/framer-step-2-drop-embed.png" alt="Drag and Drop Embed Widget" />
</div>

Now you'll have an empty Embed widget, and when you select it you'll get a sidebar on the right. You can expand the sidebar, and you'll see
something like this:

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Embed 설정 열기</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/framer-step-2-embed-sidebar.png" alt="Open Embed Settings" />
</div>

Now let's change the `Embed` widget type to `HTML`:

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">HTML 위젯으로 설정</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/framer-step-2-switch-to-html.png" alt="Set as HTML Widget" />
</div>

Now you're ready for the FastComments Framer Code snippet in the next step.
