You'll see you're supposed to pass a `broadcastId` in some API calls. When you receive events, you'll get this ID back, so you know to ignore the event if you plan to optimistically apply changes on the client (which you'll probably want to do since it offers the best experience). Pass a UUID here. The ID should be unique enough to not occur twice in a browser session.

```typescript
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';

const response = await sdk.publicApi.createCommentPublic({
  createCommentParams: {
    tenantId: 'your-tenant-id',
    urlId: 'page-id',
    comment: 'My comment',
    broadcastId: uuidv4() // Unique ID for this operation
  }
});
```
