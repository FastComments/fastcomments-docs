Third-Party Cookies are cookies that your browser sends to third parties. For example, if you log into FastComments.com
directly, by going to our site, and use our site, you are using first-party cookies. However, if you go to some_awesome_site.com
and use FastComments to comment on Awesome Site's content, then you're using third-party cookies.

However, organizations like Google use third party cookies to track your activity across multiple websites, which can be valuable
information for serving ads. This may be a reason why you *don't* want to enable third-party cookies, and you may want to specifically
whitelist FastComments.com in your browser.
