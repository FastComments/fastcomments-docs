FastComments uses third-party cookies for authentication. If you have third party cookies enabled, you don't have to verify your session every time you comment.

We have [released a workaround](https://blog.fastcomments.com/(11-21-2022)-fastcomments-now-supports-strict-third-party-cookie-settings.html) so the platform doesn't
require third party cookies anymore, but the workaround requires a popup when you comment or vote for the first time in that session.

The workaround does not get rid of the warning message when you log in. This is intentional.

For some, this is an acceptable workaround. If you'd rather not deal with the popup, read on.
