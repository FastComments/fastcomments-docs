With FastComments we can easily add live, members-only commenting to any site built with Ghost.

We will be able to **automatically import your members usernames, avatars, and have comment reply notifications setup**. 

**Note** that this tutorial requires a FastComments account. It's recommended that you sign up first and then come back here. [You can create an account here.](https://fastcomments.com/auth/tenant-signup?packageId=flex)

In this tutorial we'll be targeting a blog built with Ghost, but with a little know-how the same instructions apply to any type of site.

This tutorial starts from the perspective of a user who is very new to Ghost. Users experienced in editing their themes can skip to `Step 4`.

If you're having trouble, feel free to send your exported theme template to your support representative (still requires steps 1 - 5).
