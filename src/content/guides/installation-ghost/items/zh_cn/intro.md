With FastComments we can easily add live, members-only commenting to any site built with Ghost.

We will be able to **自动导入您的会员用户名、头像，并设置评论回复通知**。

In this tutorial we'll be targeting a blog built with Ghost, but with a little know-how the same instructions apply to any type of site.

This tutorial starts from the perspective of a user who is very new to Ghost. Users experienced in editing their themes can skip to `Step 4`.

If you're having trouble, feel free to send your exported theme template to your support representative (still requires steps 1 - 5).
