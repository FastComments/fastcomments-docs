Now we're going to open the template that is used for our blog articles. It's called `post.hbs`:

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Open post.hbs</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/ghost-step-4-1-open-post-template.png" alt="Open post.hbs" />
</div>
