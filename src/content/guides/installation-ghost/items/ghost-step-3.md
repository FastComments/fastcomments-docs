Now that we have the theme open in our editor, open `package.json` and change the `name` field to something else. In our case we just add `-fastcomments` onto the end:

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Rename Theme</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/ghost-step-3-1-name-theme.png" alt="Rename Theme" />
</div>

If you're using an IDE it will auto-save after you make this change.
