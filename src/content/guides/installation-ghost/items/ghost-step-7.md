Back in the Ghost dashboard, let's upload our theme:

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Upload Your Theme</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/ghost-step-7-1-upload.png" alt="Upload Your Theme" />
</div>

For me, I have the zip file in the following location. Note the `dist` folder:

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Select Zip to Upload</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/ghost-step-7-2-upload-select.png" alt="Select Zip to Upload" />
</div>

Remember to activate your newly uploaded theme (Ghost should ask you).
