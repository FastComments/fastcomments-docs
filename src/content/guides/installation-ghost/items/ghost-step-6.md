Now we need to package the theme files back into a zip file. To do this, use the built in features in Ghost.

Open your editor's terminal again and run `npm run zip`.

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Export Your Theme</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/ghost-step-6-1-export.png" alt="Export Your Theme" />
</div>

This will package the theme into a zip file in `dist/casper-fastcomments.zip` (if that is what you've named the theme in `Step Three`).
