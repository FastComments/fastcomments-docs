FastComments provides an easy to use SSO solution. Updating a user's information with the HMAC-based integration is
as simple as having the user load the page with an updated payload.

However, it may be desirable to manage a user outside that flow, to improve consistency of your application.

The SSO User API provides a way to CRUD objects that we call SSOUsers. These objects are different from regular Users and
kept separate for type safety.

The structure for the SSOUser object is as follows:

[inline-code-attrs-start title = 'SSOUser Structure'; type = 'typescript'; isFunctional = false; inline-code-attrs-end]
[inline-code-start]
interface SSOUser {
    id: string
    username: string
    email?: string
    websiteUrl?: string
    signUpDate: number
    createdFromUrlId?: string
    loginCount?: number
    avatarSrc?: string
    optedInNotifications?: boolean
    optedInSubscriptionNotifications?: boolean
    displayLabel?: string
    displayName?: string
    isAccountOwner?: boolean
    isAdminAdmin?: boolean
    isCommentModeratorAdmin?: boolean
    /** If null, Access Control will not be applied to the user. If an empty list, this user will not be able to see any pages or @mention other users. **/
    groupIds?: string[] | null
    createdFromSimpleSSO?: boolean
    /** Don't let other users see this user's activity, including comments, on their profile. Default is true to provide secure profiles by default. **/
    isProfileActivityPrivate?: boolean
    /** Don't let other users leave comments on the user's profile, or see existing profile comments. Default false. **/
    isProfileCommentsPrivate?: boolean
    /** Don't let other users send direct messages to this user. Default false. **/
    isProfileDMDisabled?: boolean
    karma?: number
    /** Optional configuration for user badges. **/
    badgeConfig?: {
        /** Array of badge IDs to assign to the user. Limited to 30 badges. **/
        badgeIds: string[]
        /** If true, replaces all existing displayed badges with the provided ones. If false, adds to existing badges. **/
        override?: boolean
        /** If true, updates badge display properties from tenant configuration. **/
        update?: boolean
    }
}
[inline-code-end]

### Access Control

Users can be broken into groups. This is what the `groupIds` field is for, and is optional.

### @Mentions

By default `@mentions` will use `username` to search for other sso users when the `@` character is typed. If `displayName` is used, then results matching
`username` will be ignored when there is a match for `displayName`, and the `@mention` search results will use `displayName`.

### Subscriptions

With FastComments, users can subscribe to a page by clicking the bell icon in the comment widget and clicking Subscribe.

With a regular user, we send them notification emails based on their notification settings.

With SSO Users, we split this up for backwards compatibility. Users will only get sent these additional subscription notification
emails if you set `optedInSubscriptionNotifications` to `true`.

### Badges

You can assign badges to SSO users using the `badgeConfig` property. Badges are visual indicators that appear next to a user's name in comments.

- `badgeIds` - An array of badge IDs to assign to the user. These must be valid badge IDs created in your FastComments account. Limited to 30 badges.
- `override` - If true, all existing badges displayed on comments will be replaced with the provided ones. If false or omitted, the provided badges will be added to any existing badges.
- `update` - If true, badge display properties will be updated from the tenant configuration whenever the user logs in.
