### Resource Usage

It should be noted that fetching data from the API is counted as usage on your account.

Each resource will list what that usage is in its own section.

Some resources cost more to serve than others. As such, the cost of each API call can vary. This is a function
of `Base Cost + ((Number Of Objects Returned / Response Size) * Base Cost)`.

API usage can be checked on the [Billing Analytics](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/analytics/billing) page and is updated every few minutes.

#### Note!

We suggest reading the Pages documentation first, to help limit confusion when determining what values to pass for `urlId` in the Comment API.
