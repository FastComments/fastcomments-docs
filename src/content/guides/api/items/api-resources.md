### Resource Usage

It should be noted that fetching data from the API is counted as usage on your account.

Each resource will list what that usage is in its own section.

Some resources cost more to serve than others. Each endpoint has a set cost of credits per API call. For some endpoints, the number of credits
varies based on the options and response sizes.

API usage can be checked on the [Billing Analytics](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/analytics/billing) page and is updated every few minutes.

#### Note!

We suggest reading the Pages documentation first, to help limit confusion when determining what values to pass for `urlId` in the Comment API.
