A `Comment` object represents a comment left by a user.

The relationship between parent and child comments is defined via `parentId`.

The structure for the Comment object is as follows:

[inline-code-attrs-start title = 'Comment Structure'; type = 'typescript'; isFunctional = false; inline-code-attrs-end]
[inline-code-start]
interface Comment {
    /** READONLY: Set to true if the spam engine determined the comment was spam. **/
    aiDeterminedSpam?: boolean
    /** Whether the comment is approved to show. Set to true when saving the comment, else it will be hidden. **/
    approved?: boolean
    /** The user's avatar. **/
    avatarSrc?: string
    /** Child comments. Not populated in all scenarios. Used when asTree is set to true via the API. **/
    children: Comment[]
    /** The commenter's raw comment. **/
    comment: string

    isVotedUp?: boolean
    /** The locale the comment is in. If not provided, will be derived from the language accept HTTP header. **/
    locale?: 'de_de' | 'en_us' | 'es_es' | 'fr_fr' | 'it_it' | 'ja_jp' | 'ko_kr' | 'pl_pl' | 'pt_br' | 'ru_ru' | 'tr_tr' | 'zh_cn' | 'zh_tw'
    /** READONLY: The @mentions written in the comment that were successfully parsed. **/
    mentions?: CommentUserMention[]
    /** Optional metadata associated with the comment. **/
    meta?: Record<string, string | number | boolean>
    /** The optional list of moderation group ids associated with this comment. **/
    moderationGroupIds?: string[]|null
    /** READONLY: The id of the vote object that corresponds to the vote from the current user (contextUserId) on this comment. **/
    myVoteId?: string
    /** Whether notifications were sent for this comment for commenters. To prevent notifications being sent on imports, set this to true. **/
    notificationSentForParent?: boolean
    /** Whether notifications were sent for this comment for tenant users. To prevent notifications being sent on imports, set this to true. **/
    notificationSentForParentTenant?: boolean
    /** The title of the page this comment was on. **/
    pageTitle?: string

    tenantId: string

    userId?: string|null
    /** The URL to the location that this comment is visible, like a blog post. **/
    url: string
    /** A "cleaned" version of the urlId you passed us. When saving, you specify this field, but when you fetch the comment back this will be "cleaned" and your original value moved to "urlIdRaw". **/
    urlId: string
    /** READONLY: The original urlId you passed us. **/
    urlIdRaw?: string
    /** Is the user and this comment verified? **/
    verified: boolean
    /** Number of votes up. **/

    votesDown?: number
    /** The "karma" of the comment (= votes up - votes down). **/
    votes?: number
}

Some of these fields are marked `READONLY` - these are returned by the API but cannot be set.

### Comment Text Structure

Comments are written in a FastComments flavor of markdown, which is just markdown plus traditional `bbcode` style tags for images, like `[img]path[/img]`.

Text is stored in two fields. The text the user entered is stored unmodified in the `comment` field. This is rendered and stored in the `commentHTML` field.

The allowed HTML tags are `b, u, i, strike, pre, span, code, img, a, strong, ul, ol, li, and br`.

It's recommended to render the HTML, since it is a very small subset of HTML, building a renderer is pretty straightforward. There are multiple libraries for React Native and Flutter, for instance, to help with this

You may choose to render the un-normalized value of the `comment` field. [An example parser is here.](https://github.com/FastComments/fastcomments-code-examples/blob/master/custom-client/client/parse-comment.js).

The example parser could also be adjusted to work with HTML, and transform the HTML tags into expected elements to render for your platform. 

### Tagging

When users are tagged in a comment, the information is stored in a list called `mentions`. Each object in that list
has the following structure.

[inline-code-attrs-start title = 'The Comment Mentions Object'; type = 'typescript'; inline-code-attrs-end]
[inline-code-start]
interface CommentUserMention {
    /** The user id. For SSO users, this will have your tenant id prefixed. **/
    id: string
    /** The final @mention tag text, including the @ symbol. **/
    tag: string
    /** The original @mention tag text, including the @ symbol. **/
    rawTag: string
    /** What type of user was tagged. user = FastComments.com account. sso = SSOUser. **/
    type: 'user'|'sso'
    /** If the user opts out of notifications, this will still be set to true. **/
    sent: boolean
}
[inline-code-end]

### HashTags

When hashtags are used and successfully parsed, the information is stored in a list called `hashTags`. Each object in that list
has the following structure.

[inline-code-attrs-start title = 'The Comment HashTag Object'; type = 'typescript'; inline-code-attrs-end]
[inline-code-start]
interface CommentHashTag {
    /** The hashtag id. **/
    id: string
    /** The final #hashtag tag text, including the # symbol. **/
    tag: string
    /** If the hashtag is associated with a custom URL, this will be defined. **/
    url?: string
    /** If we should retain the hashtag, even if it does not exist in the comment text, when the comment is updated. Useful for tagging comments without changing comment text. **/
    retain?: boolean
}
