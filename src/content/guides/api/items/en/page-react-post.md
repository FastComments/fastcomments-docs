Adds a reaction to a page as the current user. A user can add each reaction id once: adding it again succeeds with the code `already-reacted` and does not change the count. A user can add several different reactions to the same page.

Reaction ids are chosen by you and may be up to 36 characters. The page is created if it does not exist yet. Pass `title` to set or update the page's title.
