Retracts a vote. The option it was cast on gives its count back, and the voter is free to vote again.

### Other Notes

- Deleting the same vote twice responds with `not-found` the second time, and the counts are left alone.
- If the poll was replaced since the vote was cast, the vote is removed but no count changes, since the
  replacement started from zero.
