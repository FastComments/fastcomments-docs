[api-resource-header-start name = 'Page Reacts'; route = 'GET /page-reacts/v2/:tenantId'; creditsCost = 0; api-resource-header-end]

Returns the count for each reaction on a page, and which reactions the current user has added.

Pass `includeUserInfo=public` to also get the users who reacted, as one entry per react with its reaction id, most recent first. Users with private profile activity and anonymous users are left out, and up to 100 reacts are looked up. Only `public` is accepted here; `include-private` returns a `422` and is available from [`GET /api/v1/pages/reacts`](/guide-api.html#pages-reacts-get) with an API key. On pages that require SSO, `includeUserInfo` returns a `403` for users who cannot view the page.
