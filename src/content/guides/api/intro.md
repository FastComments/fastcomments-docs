### The FastComments API

FastComments provides an API for interacting with many resources. Build integrations with our platform, or even build your own clients!

In this documentation, you will find all supported resources by the API documented with
their request and response types.

For Enterprise customers, all API access is captured in the Audit Log.

### Authentication

The API is authenticated by passing your [api key](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/api-secret) as either an `API_KEY` header or query parameter. You will also need your `tenantId`
for making API calls. This can be retrieved from the same page as your api key.
