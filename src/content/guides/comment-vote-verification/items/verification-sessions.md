FastComments implements a unique solution to user verification to reduce the number of emails
sent to your users we call Verification Sessions.

If a new user leaves ten comments and votes twice on the same page, in the same browser window, there is no
need to send them a dozen confirmation emails.

Instead, FastComments will only send one verification email in this scenario.

This does not require cookies.

If the browser window is closed, or the user navigates away, that is considered the end of the verification session.
