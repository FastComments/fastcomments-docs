As soon as comments and votes are verified, no matter the mechanism, the update is immediately published live.

If it's a comment that is verified, and it is already approved, the "Unverified comment" label will be removed for all
users viewing that comment thread.

Similarly, if a pending vote is verified, the affected comment's karma will automatically be updated live.
