Unverified comments will display with a small "Unverified comment:" tag, and appear slightly faded
out.

This can all be customized, see our [customization guide](/guide-customizations-and-configuration.html#custom-css).

Unverified comments can be configured to be expired, see our [Moderation Settings](/guide-moderation.html#moderation-settings) documentation.

Anonymous comments are always unverified - since the user did not leave an email that could
be used for verification.

Allowing Anonymous Commenting does not remove the Unverified label, however this can be removed with styling or [configuration](/guide-customizations-and-configuration.html#disable-unverified-label).
