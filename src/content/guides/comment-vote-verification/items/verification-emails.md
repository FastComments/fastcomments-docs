When a user leaves a comment, or vote, and they are not logged in, or their account is
unverified, they will receive an email asking them to verify this action.

However, we do our best not to spam your users with emails, and won't send more than one
verification email per session. See the Sessions section for more details.

By default, the comment verification emails look like the following:

[app-screenshot-start url='/test-e2e/email/commenter-verify-post?comment=%7B"commenterName"%3A"Alexander"%2C"comment"%3A"This%20is%20my%20comment."%2C"commentHTML"%3A"This%20is%20my%20comment."%2C"date"%3A1588812198540%7D&removedInDays=3&FC_DOMAIN=https%3A%2F%2Ffastcomments.com&tenant=%7B"removeUnverifiedComments"%3Atrue%7D&verifyPostUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com&locale=en_us&API_KEY=T0ph%20123!'; linkUrl=false; selector = '.content'; title='Comment Verification Email' app-screenshot-end]

By default, the vote verification emails look like the following:

[app-screenshot-start url='/test-e2e/email/commenter-verify-vote?vote=%7B"commenterName"%3A"Devon"%2C"comment"%3A"This%20is%20my%20comment.%20I%20totally%20left%20it%20intentionally.%20Yup."%2C"date"%3A1588812198540%7D&commenterName=Devon&url=some%20-%20url&removedInDays=3&FC_DOMAIN=https%3A%2F%2Ffastcomments.com&tenant=%7B"removeUnverifiedComments"%3Atrue%7D&verifyUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com&locale=en_us&API_KEY=T0ph%20123!'; linkUrl=false; selector = '.content'; title='Vote Verification Email' app-screenshot-end]

By default, FastComments will show its logo and name in the footer of these emails:

[app-screenshot-start url='/test-e2e/email/commenter-verify-vote?vote=%7B"commenterName"%3A"Devon"%2C"comment"%3A"This%20is%20my%20comment.%20I%20totally%20left%20it%20intentionally.%20Yup."%2C"date"%3A1588812198540%7D&commenterName=Devon&url=some%20-%20url&removedInDays=3&FC_DOMAIN=https%3A%2F%2Ffastcomments.com&tenant=%7B"removeUnverifiedComments"%3Atrue%7D&verifyUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com&locale=en_us&API_KEY=T0ph%20123!'; linkUrl=false; selector = '.footer'; title='Email Footer' app-screenshot-end]
