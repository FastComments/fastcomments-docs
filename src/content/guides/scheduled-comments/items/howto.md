Using FastComments Scheduled Comments is simple. First, you'll want to [import the comments here](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/manage-data/import-scheduled).

This page can also be accessed via `Manage Data->Schedule Comments`.

After importing, you have the option to start playing back comments. This will play back the comments on each page you've defined in the CSV
file, with the delays between each comment based on the delay you specified.

Every comment will be posted **live**. You may want to consider [turning on showing live comments right away](/guide-customizations-and-configuration.html#show-live-right-away).

You can learn about the import format in the Import Format section of this documentation.
