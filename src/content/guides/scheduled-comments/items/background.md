Scheduled Comments is a FastComments feature to play back comments over a period of time, making it appear as though
real users are leaving comments. For example, you could have one comment posted after a few seconds, and then a few
seconds later another comment as a reply, and so on. Every comment can have its own username, avatar, as desired.

This can be useful for webinars or other events where it may be desirable to kick off conversations in an automated way.
