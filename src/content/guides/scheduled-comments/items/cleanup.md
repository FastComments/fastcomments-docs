For automatically playing comments (not manually scheduled), the
auto played comments are not actually saved, but users' real comments are.

If you re-use the same URL for multiple events, you may want to clean up
the comments at the end.

You can do this easily by going here:

https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/moderate-comments?byIPFromComment=&filter=&text-search=&page=1&count=1000

... and selecting "Select All" and then "Delete". This URL will allow deleting 1k comments at once, but you
can adjust this filter on the page.

This will delete all of your comments in your account. If you want to only delete those
for a specific URL, just enter the URL in the search box on the comment moderation page.
