FastComments can run a tool on your blog to import your existing comments. However, this must be done *before* you
disable them in step 2, otherwise they are not available when we run the tool.

Please [create a support ticket](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/tickets) for this step. Usually the import
completes in less than a day.

If you don't care about retaining your existing comments, move on to Step 2.
