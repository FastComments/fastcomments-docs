Notifications can be opted out in several ways. If your account is managed by FastComments.com and not via SSO, you can configure your
notifications via the [Notifications Settings page](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/edit-notifications).

Here you can configure comment reply and mention notifications, notification frequency (every minute, hourly, or daily), subscription notification frequency (every minute, hourly, or daily), and any notification in general. If you are a site admin or
moderator you will also have a separate **Admin Notification Frequency** setting that controls how often you receive emails about new comments on your site (defaults to hourly), as well as the option of configuring the Digest Email frequency.

Additionally, each email contains an opt-out link. For comment reply notifications, the email contains a link to **opt out of notifications for that comment**.

Notifications will also have an unsubscribe link for turning them off, as well as the appropriate email headers.

Unsubscribe links in emails can be removed at request for a given tenant. Additionally, the link can be customized for SSO or whitelabel integrations.
