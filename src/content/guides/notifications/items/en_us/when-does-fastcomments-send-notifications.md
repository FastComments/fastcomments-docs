At FastComments, we know you get enough notifications already. Because of this, we take measures to limit the notifications users receive while still keeping them connected to their communities. We also want to keep administrators and moderators up to date and let them know when action needs to be taken.

#### We'll send notifications for the following events for administrators and moderators:

- Community Digest Summary (frequency configurable).
- Community help requests and reminders.
- New Comments This Hour.

#### For Commenters:

- When someone replies to your comment (via email).
- When you are mentioned (in-app and email notifications).
- When someone replies in the same thread (in-app and email notifications).
- When someone replies to a child comment in the same thread (in-app and email notifications).
- When someone replies to a page you have subscribed to (in-app and email notifications).
- When a user comments for the first time (But not with SSO).
- When a user leaves a comment in a session that is not verified (But not with SSO).
  - We do not send multiple verification emails in this case. Only the first one, which will verify all activity in the same session.

#### ...and finally for administrators only:

- When integrations are complete.
- When migrations are complete.
- When imports or exports finish.
- When there are billing issues.
- Trial-end reminders.

Some notifications are batched up to prevent mass-sending of notifications to users. Learn about this in the next section `Notification Types`.
