Notifications can be opted out in several ways. If your account is managed by FastComments.com and not via SSO, you can configure your
notifications via the [Notifications Settings page](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/edit-notifications).

Here you can configure comment reply and mention notifications, hourly new comment notifications, and any notification in general. If you are a site admin or
moderator you will have the option of configuring the Digest Email frequency here as well.

Additionally, each email contains an opt-out link. For comment reply notifications, the email contains a link to **opt out of notifications for that comment**.

Notifications will also have an unsubscribe link for turning them off, as well as the appropriate email headers.

Unsubscribe links in emails can be removed at request for a given tenant. Additionally, the link can be customized for SSO or whitelabel integrations.
