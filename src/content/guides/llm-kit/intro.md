## LLM Kit

The FastComments LLM Kit helps AI coding assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, and Cursor understand and integrate with FastComments by providing them access to our complete documentation through a simple search API.

By adding a snippet to your project's AGENT.md or CLAUDE.md file, you enable AI assistants to quickly search and retrieve relevant FastComments documentation, making implementation faster and more accurate.
