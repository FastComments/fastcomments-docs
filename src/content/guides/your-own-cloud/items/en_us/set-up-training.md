We provide training for developers and moderators whom you expect to use the system.

This is done as part of two two-hour sessions, which can be scheduled separately. The idea
being that after the first session you have time to formulate questions and topics you may
want us to focus on in the second session.

Developer and admin/moderator training are separate and can be purchased separately or together.
