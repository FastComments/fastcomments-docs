We provide training for developers and moderators that you expect to use the system.

This is done as part of two two-hour sessions, which can be scheduled separately. The idea
being that after the first session you have time to formulate questions and topics you may
want us to focus on in the second session.

The developer and admin/moderator training is separate, purchased separately or together.
