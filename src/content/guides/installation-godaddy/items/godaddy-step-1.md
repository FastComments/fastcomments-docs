To add FastComments to our Godaddy site we're going to add an area to put the FastComments.com widget code.

**Note!** Ensure you have added a blog section and at least one blog post to your site before continuing.

Let's add an HTML code area by moving our mouse below the blog post in the site editor, and clicking `Add Section` as follows:

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Add Section</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/godaddy-step-1-add-section.png" alt="Add Section" />
</div>

Now search for `HTML`. Once the "Embed custom code on the page" box shows up, click `Add`.

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Add HTML Box</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/godaddy-step-1-add-html.png" alt="Add HTML Box" />
</div>

You should now see an empty code area in the editor.

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Empty Code Area</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/godaddy-step-1-section-added.png" alt="Empty Code Area" />
</div>

Click on the empty code area you've added. On the bottom right you'll now see a `Custom Code` input field.

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Custom Code Input Area</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/godaddy-step-1-add-code-area.png" alt="Custom Code Input Area" />
</div>

That's it for step one! In step two we will be adding our custom Godaddy-specific code.
