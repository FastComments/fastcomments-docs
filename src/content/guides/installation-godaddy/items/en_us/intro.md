With FastComments, we can easily add live commenting to any site built with GoDaddy.

Note that this tutorial requires a FastComments account. It's recommended that you sign up first and then come back here. [You can create an account here.](https://fastcomments.com/auth/tenant-signup?packageId=flex)

We'll be covering adding FastComments to a blog built with GoDaddy, but the same general instructions apply to any site.
