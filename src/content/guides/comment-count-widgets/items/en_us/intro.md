FastComments provides lightweight, standalone comment count widgets that can display the number of comments for specific pages or posts. These widgets are separate from the main commenting widget and are designed to be used anywhere you want to show comment counts without the full commenting interface.

There are two types of comment count widgets available:

1. **Comment Count Widget** - For displaying the comment count of a single page
2. **Bulk Comment Count Widget** - For efficiently displaying comment counts across multiple pages on the same page

This article covers the VanillaJS widgets. Our React/Angular/etc libraries also have their own widgets.
