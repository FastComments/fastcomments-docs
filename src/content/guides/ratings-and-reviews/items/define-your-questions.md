FastComments supports a few question types:

- NPS
- Slider
- Star
- Up/Down Thumbs

Questions are created in the [Questions Dashboard](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/questions).

Each question should have the following defined:

- A good Internal Name.
  - Used when reporting and listing questions in the admin dashboards.
- A Reporting Order.
  - Used when reporting and listing questions in the admin dashboards.
- Question Text.
  - This is shown to users.
- Summary Label.
  - This is shown to users who interact with summary widgets.

Other questions will have configuration specific for that type. For example, the Star question allows you to define the number of stars, the slider allows you to define the min/max, and so on.

### Sub Questions

At the bottom of this page you see a large star rating question, and then some small ones. The small ones are sub ratings. After you setup all your questions you can go back
to editing your top level question and select which ones are sub questions.

Sub questions can be configured to show along with each review, show in the summary widgets, or only be exposed internally via the Widget Configuration (shown next).
