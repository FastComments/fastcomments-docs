Once you define questions the admin dashboard will show a nav item for [Feedback Analytics](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/feedback-analytics).

The following roles allow accessing the feedback analytics:

- Super Admin
- Account Owner
- Comment Moderator Admin

Each question will show an Over Time trend, an Overall Breakdown, and the entire report can be sliced by Day, Month, or Year. You are not billed for viewing the results.
