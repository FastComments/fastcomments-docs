Pricing is based on comment pricing; that is, you are billed for ratings & reviews the same as comments—depending on your package.

You are billed (on Flex) or limited (on fixed plans) based on the following:

- The number of reviews you have in your account (same as Comment pricing).
- Summary widget usage:
  - Each page load uses 1 API credit for each question plus sub-question if the aggregation is cached, and twice that if not.
  - So if you have a main question and three sub-questions, most of the time you are billed 4 credits each page load, and sometimes when the results need to be recalculated you are billed 8 credits.
- API usage (credit usage for each API call included in the respective docs).

When results are aggregated, either via the API or via the summary widgets, you are also billed.
