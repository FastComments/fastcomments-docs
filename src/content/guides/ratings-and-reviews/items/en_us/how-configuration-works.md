Most of FastComments is customized via the [Customize UI](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/customize-widget). This includes Ratings & Reviews.

Once you add questions, they won't be used anywhere yet.

To use them, create or edit a customization rule and enable the `Enable Ratings or Other Questions` option. This will show a few other options:

- Style
  - Vertical or Side-by-Side
- When to Save?
  - Should we save the feedback as the user answers questions, or all at once at the end when they submit their review?
- Ask Sub Questions
  - Whether to show the defined sub questions.
- Questions Required?
  - Whether all the questions are required.
- Show Answers on Comments?
  - Whether to show the rating or rating & sub ratings with each review.
- Show Results Breakdown After Answering
  - When enabled, after a user answers a question, an aggregated breakdown of all responses for that page is displayed. This includes average values, distribution bars, and response counts. Supported for Star, NPS, Thumbs, and Slider question types, including sub-questions.
- Question to Show?
  - The top level question you want to show. Only one is supported today.

This configuration caters to a couple of main use cases (page reactions and ratings & reviews), since it can be used for both as well as for simple surveys.

The reason we use the Customization UI is that decoupling this configuration from the questions themselves allows you to define different questions for different sites or different
pages by customizing the widget configuration which lets you select either all sites/pages or a specific domain and page.
