Most of FastComments is customized via the [Özelleştirme Arayüzü](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/customize-widget). This includes Değerlendirmeler ve İncelemeler.

Once you add questions, they won't be used anywhere yet.

To use them, create or edit a customization rule and enable the `Enable Ratings or Other Questions` option. This will show a few other options:

- Style
  - Vertical or Side-by-Side
- When to Save?
  - Should we save the feedback as the user answers questions, or at once at the end when they submit their review?
- Ask Sub Questions
  - Whether to show the defined sub questions.
- Questions Required?
  - Whether all the questions are required.
- Show Answers on Comments?
  - Whether to show the rating or rating & sub ratings with each review.
- Question to Show?
  - The top level question you want to show. Only one is supported today.

This configuration is to cater to a couple main use cases (page reactions and also ratings & reviews) as it can be used for both and also simple surveys.

The reason we use the Customization UI is that decoupling this configuration from the questions themselves allows you to define different questions for different sites or different
pages by customizing the widget configuration which allows you to select either all sites/pages, or a specific domain and page.
