The FastComments WordPress plugin will replace the default WordPress count mechanism with a system provided by FastComments. We will make one asynchronous request
per page load when there are a list of posts with comment counts to show. If the user has JavaScript disabled, it will fall back to the default WordPress counts so there
is not a loss in functionality.
