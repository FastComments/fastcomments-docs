The FastComments WordPress 外掛安裝設計為簡便，並儘量減少您網站留言功能的停機時間。在同步完成之前，外掛不會從 WordPress 外掛切換過來。

First, you'll want to set the expectation with your moderators according to the details in the below section `Moderation`. Let them know soon they will
be moderating from FastComments, and not the WordPress dashboard.

Next, install the plugin. You can do this by going to the WordPress plugins dashboard, clicking `Add Plugin`, and search for `FastComments`. The plugin is also available for download [這裡](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fastcomments/#installation).

The plugin setup will ask you if you are in the EU. If this is the case, your account will reside in the EU on `eu.fastcomments.com`, otherwise it will be on `fastcomments.com`.

Next, you have the option of selecting whether you already have a FastComments account. Follow the steps thereafter and your comments can optionally be uploaded during the installation process.

<sup>注意！</sup> 請勿在設定與同步進行中關閉 WordPress 外掛頁面。

Comments are uploaded in batches, and sorted using existing indexes in your WordPress database to limit load on your site.

Once the sync is complete, the default WordPress commenting system will be replaced by FastComments. We hope you love our platform, but if you don't [聯絡我們](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/help).
