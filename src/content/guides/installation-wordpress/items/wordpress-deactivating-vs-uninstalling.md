Deactivating the plugin will remove your token from your WordPress install. Your data remains on FastComments servers until you delete your account. If you re-activate the plugin, then you will
have to perform the initial sync again.

Uninstalling the plugin removes all data related to the plugin, but you still would have to delete your FastComments account to delete the data that resides there.
