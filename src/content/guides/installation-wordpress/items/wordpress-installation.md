The FastComments WordPress plugin installation is designed to be easy and limit any downtime of availability of commenting on your site. The plugin will not switch over from the WordPress plugin until the sync is complete.

First, you'll want to set the expectation with your moderators according to the details in the below section `Moderation`. Let them know soon they will
be moderating from FastComments, and not the WordPress dashboard.

Next, install the plugin. You can do this by going to the WordPress plugins dashboard, clicking `Add Plugin`, and search for `FastComments`. The plugin is also available for download [here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fastcomments/#installation).

The plugin setup will ask you if you are in the EU. If this is the case, your account will reside in the EU on `eu.fastcomments.com`, otherwise it will be on `fastcomments.com`.

Next, you have the option of selecting whether you already have a FastComments account. Follow the steps thereafter and your comments can optionally be uploaded during the installation process.

<sup>Note!</sup> Do not close the WordPress plugin page while the setup and sync is in progress.

Comments are uploaded in batches, and sorted using existing indexes in your WordPress database to limit load on your site.

Once the sync is complete, the default WordPress commenting system will be replaced by FastComments. We hope you love our platform, but if you don't [reach out to us](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/help).
