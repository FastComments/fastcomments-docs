FastComments and the corresponding WordPress plugin are ready for your moderators and admins to keep working.

You'll most likely want to add your administrators to [User & Administrators](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/users) and your moderators to [Comment Moderators](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/moderate-comments/moderators).

This is required if you are not using SSO.
