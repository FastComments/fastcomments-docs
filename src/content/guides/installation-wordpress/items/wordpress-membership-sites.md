FastComments works with membership-only sites by using what is called SSO, or single-sign-on. Your members sign in to your WordPress site, but
don't have to worry about creating an account with FastComments, or login with social media, to comment. If your members (including admins) are logged into
your WordPress site, they will be able to comment. Your admins and moderators will be able to moderate comments directly from your WordPress blog posts, as well.

<sup>(Optional)</sup> Remember to also add your administrators to [User & Administrators](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/users) and moderators to [Comment Moderators](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/moderate-comments/moderators)
to improve their experience and enable stat tracking for moderators.

SSO can be enabled by going to the plugin dashboard and clicking "SSO Settings".

You will first have to enable the "Anyone can Register" feature of your site.

All user information is seamlessly and securely transferred to FastComments each time a user views a comment thread via [HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC).

There is no initial or continuous sync that needs to be run to copy your members over to FastComments servers. This is automatically done when they view comment threads by opening a blog post.
