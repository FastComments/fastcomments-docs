You may get an authorization error, like the following:

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Domain Configuration Missing</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/installation-guide-webflow-step-5.png" alt="Domain Configuration Missing" />
</div>

This is because FastComments doesn't know it's supposed to allow your account to be used on this domain.

In this case, the fix is simple. We just have to add our site to our FastComments.com account.

[Go here to add your site to your account.](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/configure-domains)

Domains are automatically added to your account during the trial period, but this can occur when adding new sites to your FastComments account.
