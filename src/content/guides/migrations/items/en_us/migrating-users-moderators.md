With FastComments, many users can be added to your tenant, and their permissions can be set up based on the roles in your
organization.

[app-screenshot-start url='/auth/my-account/users/new/edit'; selector = '.account-block'; title='Adding a User' app-screenshot-end]

Users can be added via this UI. If you have many users, we can import them for you [via customer support](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/help).

For adding moderators, see [the corresponding documentation](/guide-moderation#moderators-adding).

### A Note about Authentication

Your users may be looking for a place to enter their password. FastComments uses "magic links" for logging in - so no passwords are required.
