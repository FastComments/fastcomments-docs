With FastComments, a conversation has to be first created before it can be embedded.

To do so, simply visit [fastcomments.com/create](https://fastcomments.com/create).

[app-screenshot-start url='/create'; selector = '.content'; title='The Create a Conversation Form' app-screenshot-end]

Once choosing a name, a secure link will be created.

This link can be visited and used as its own chat. Or, it can be provided directly to an application that supports oEmbed, or https://embed.ly, to
insert the conversation.

Embedded conversations can be customized just like any other FastComments installation using the Customization UI. Read about customizing the comment widget [here](/guide-customizations-and-configuration.html).
