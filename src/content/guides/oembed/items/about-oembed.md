To quote https://oembed.com:

> oEmbed is a format for allowing an embedded representation of a URL on third party sites. The simple API allows a website to display embedded content (such as photos or videos) when a user posts a link to that resource, without having to parse the resource directly.

FastComments supports the oEmbed format and is available through products that use https://embed.ly.
