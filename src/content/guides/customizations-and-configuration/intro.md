## Customizations and Configuration

### Context

Here you will find in-depth documentation on each of the features and settings that the comment widget supports.

This documentation will cover core concepts, and will go deep into each area of functionality, with how-tos and common gotchas.

Code examples will be provided, with relevant lines highlighted. Screenshots of configuration pages will be provided where applicable.

The code examples will use our vanilla JavaScript library, however the configuration options use the exact same names for all versions of the comment widget (React, Vue, etc).

Most configuration and features outlined in this guide do not require writing any code.
