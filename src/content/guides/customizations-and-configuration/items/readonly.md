[related-parameter-start name = 'readonly'; type = 'boolean'; related-parameter-end]

Commenting can be locked so no new comments or votes can be left by setting the readonly flag to true.

Comments will also be unable to be edited or deleted.

[code-example-start config = {readonly: true}; linesToHighlight = [6]; title = 'Making The Comment Thread Readonly'; code-example-end]

This can be customized without code, on the widget customization page:

[app-screenshot-start url='/auth/my-account/customize-widget/new'; selector = '.prevent-new-replies'; title='Making The Comment Thread Readonly' app-screenshot-end]
