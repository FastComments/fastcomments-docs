When users enter hashtags, in the form of `#someexampletag`, FastComments will automatically create that `HashTag` and 
highlight it in their comment.

In some cases it's desirable to disable this feature, or control what hashtags can be used via the API.

To do so, simply enable `Disable Automatic #hashtag Creation` via the Widget Customization UI.

[app-screenshot-start url='/auth/my-account/customize-widget/new'; clickSelectors = ['.disable-automatic-hash-tag-creation']; selector = '.disable-automatic-hash-tag-creation'; title='Disabling Automatic HashTag Creation' app-screenshot-end]
