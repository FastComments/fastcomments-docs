FastComments can be configured to remove unverified comments after a desired number of days. This helps combat spam.

By default, it does not.

This can be configured, or disabled, via the <a href="https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/moderate-comments/settings" target="_blank">Moderation Settings</a> page.
