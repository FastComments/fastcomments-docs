By default, FastComments requires an email to comment. It does not have to be a valid email; however, until the user clicks a link sent to them,
their comment will display an "Unverified Comment" label.

However, you can remove the email requirement. The email input field will still show, but it will no longer be required.

This can be configured via the widget customization UI:

[app-screenshot-start url='/auth/my-account/customize-widget/new'; selector = '.allow-anonymous-comments'; title='Enabling Anonymous Comments' app-screenshot-end]
