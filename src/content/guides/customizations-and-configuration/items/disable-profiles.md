[related-parameter-start name = 'disableProfiles'; type = 'boolean'; related-parameter-end]

By default, FastComments will show the user's profile when you click on their avatar.

However, we can disable this functionality:

[code-example-start config = {disableProfiles: true}; linesToHighlight = [6]; title = 'Disable Profiles'; code-example-end]

This can also be done without code. In the widget customization page, see the "Disable Profiles" section.

[app-screenshot-start url='/auth/my-account/customize-widget/new'; clickSelectors = ['.disable-profiles']; selector = '.disable-profiles'; title='Disable Profiles' app-screenshot-end]
