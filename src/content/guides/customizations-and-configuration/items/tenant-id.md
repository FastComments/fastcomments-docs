You may notice that the comment widget can be used with a tenant id of type demo, for example:

[code-example-start config = {tenantId: 'demo'}; linesToHighlight = [5]; title = 'Demo Tenant ID'; code-example-end]

This is only meant to try out and play with the comment widget. In production, you would pass your Tenant ID, like so:

[code-example-start config = {tenantId: 'aKa2Z4Q='}; linesToHighlight = [5]; title = 'Defining Your Tenant ID'; code-example-end]

Your Tenant ID can be found already applied on the comment widget <a href="https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/get-acct-code">code snippet in your account</a>.
