By default, FastComments will render links like this: [https://exmaple.com](https://exmaple.com) - リンクの URL がクリック可能な
HTML アンカータグになります。

Some sites may want to disable this, for example to discourage scammers. We provide this by setting the `Comment HTML Rendering Option` to `Links as Text`.

This can be customized without code, on the widget customization page, for an entire domain, or page:

[app-screenshot-start url='/auth/my-account/customize-widget/new'; clickSelectors = ['.show-advanced-option']; selector = '.comment-html-rendering-mode'; title='Render Links as Text' app-screenshot-end]
