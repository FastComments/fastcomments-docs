FastComments provides several ways to highlight new comments.

First and foremost, by default comments that triggered an in-app notification (replies, replies in same thread, or comments on a page
that you're subscribed to), will automatically be highlighted with the user's avatar glowing slightly. The color can be customized via CSS
using the `is-unread` class.

Comments posted in the last 24 hours have a `24hr` class applied that can be used for styling.

Finally, any new live comments that show up in the user's session will be highlighted for several seconds via an animation. This is done via the
`is-live` CSS class and can be customized as well.
