Sometimes FastComments has to email your users on your behalf, especially if you are not using Secure SSO.

Examples of this include when commenting for the first time, and they need to verify their account or activity. FastComments
will also send them notifications for replies to their comments.

When FastComments emails your users, we will use a default From Name and Email of `FastComments Robot` and `noreply@fastcomments.com`.

This can be customized on a per-domain basis via the My Domains page:

[app-screenshot-start url='/auth/my-account/configure-domains'; selector = '.account-block form'; title='Customizing From Name and Email' app-screenshot-end]
