Sometimes FastComments has to email your users, especially if you are not using Secure SSO.

Examples of this includes verifying their account or activity when commenting for the first time. FastComments
will also send them notifications for replies to their comments.

When FastComments emails your users, we will use a default From Name and Email of `FastComments Robot` and `noreply@fastcomments.com`.

This can be customized on a per-domain basis via the "My Domains page":

[app-screenshot-start url='/auth/my-account/configure-domains'; selector = '.account-block form'; title='Customizing From Name and Email' app-screenshot-end]
