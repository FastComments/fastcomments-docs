Comments themselves are not tied to a particular domain. They are tied to your account, and the "<a href="/guide-customizations-and-configuration.html#url-id" target="_blank">urlId</a>" provided.

This means that we can render the same comment thread on two separate sites with the same FastComments account by simply passing in the same value for "urlId" in
the widget configuration.

In this scenario, comments posted on page A would immediately appear on page B, and vice-versa. Live commenting
also works as expected.
