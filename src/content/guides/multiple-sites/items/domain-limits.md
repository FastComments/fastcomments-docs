To found out the limit for the number of domains in your account, visit the [Billing Page](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/billing-info).

### Traffic Limits & Domains

In the example where you are on a tier with five million monthly page loads with five domains added to your account, and
each domain ends up with one million page loads, you will have met your monthly quota.

To summarize, traffic limitations are per-account, not per-domain.
