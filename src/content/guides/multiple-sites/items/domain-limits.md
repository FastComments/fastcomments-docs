### Traffic Limits & Domains

In the example where you are on a tier with five million monthly page loads with five domains added to your account, and
each domain ends up with one million-page loads, you will have met your monthly quota.

To summarize, traffic limitations are per-account, not per-domain.

Note that we do offer custom packages for different size sites, simply reach out to support.
