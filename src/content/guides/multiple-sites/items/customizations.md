The comment widget can be <a href="/guide-customizations-and-configuration.html#custom-css" target="_blank">customized</a> differently for each site.

On the widget customization page, you'll find a dropdown labeled "domain". Selecting `All` in this field will apply the rule to all
sites on your account, you can enter a specific domain which will restrict the settings or custom CSS you wish to apply to only that domain.

This allows you to have FastComments look or function completely different for each site.

[app-screenshot-start url='/auth/my-account/customize-widget/new'; selector = 'label.domain'; title='Customization Rule Domain' app-screenshot-end]

For one site might use bold text and allow anonymous commenting, and another site might
have different styling and require the user to leave their email when they comment.
