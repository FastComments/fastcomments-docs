FastComments is designed to be customized to match your blog's design.

If you'd like to add custom styling, or tweak configuration, [Checkout our Customization Documentation](/guide-customizations-and-configuration.html) to learn how.

For Typeflo.io blogs, you can add custom CSS styles in the same Custom Code section where you added the FastComments script.
