This guide provides the complete default CSS used by the FastComments commenting widget (v2) and some instructions
for overriding the styles.

Understanding the default CSS allows you to:

- **Customize the appearance** by overriding specific styles
- **Troubleshoot styling issues** by seeing which classes and selectors are available
- **Build custom themes** that work with the widget's structure
- **Use with AI assistants** to generate custom CSS modifications.

## How to Override Styles

Overriding styles varies based on the widget. For the comment widget, you have to use the `customCSS` config parameter to
pass the CSS into the iframe, or specify the CSS in the Customization page in the admin dashboard which will serve the CSS
from our CDN.
