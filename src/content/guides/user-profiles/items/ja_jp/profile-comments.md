Profile Comments allow users to leave messages directly on another user's profile page, creating a personal comment wall or guestbook-style interaction.

### What Are Profile Comments?

Profile Comments are different from regular article comments:
- They appear on a user's profile page, not on content articles
- They're visible to anyone viewing the profile (unless privacy settings restrict this)
- They're a way to recognize, thank, or communicate with specific users
- They work across all FastComments communities

### Leaving a Profile Comment

To comment on someone's profile:

1. Visit the user's profile page
2. Navigate to the "プロフィールコメント" tab
3. Use the comment box to write your message
4. Submit the comment

**Note:** The profile owner's privacy settings determine whether your comment appears immediately or requires approval.

### Viewing Profile Comments

**On Your Own Profile:**
1. Visit your profile page
2. Click the "プロフィールコメント" tab
3. See all comments others have left on your profile

**On Other Profiles:**
Profile comments are visible if the user hasn't enabled the "プロフィールコメントを非公開にする" setting.

### Comment Approval

Depending on the profile owner's settings (see [プライバシー設定](/guides/user-profiles/privacy-settings)), comments may:

1. **Appear Immediately** - Auto-approved based on trust level or approval settings
2. **Require Approval** - Held for the profile owner to review

When your comment requires approval:
- You'll see a pending status indicator
- The profile owner receives a notification
- Once approved, the comment becomes visible to others

### Managing Profile Comments on Your Profile

If you've configured comment approval (「すべて手動承認」または「新規手動承認」), you can manage incoming comments:

**Via Email:**
You'll receive email notifications with approve/reject links for pending comments. Click the link to take action directly from your email.

**From Your Profile:**
1. Visit your profile's "プロフィールコメント" tab
2. View pending comments
3. Approve or reject each comment

**From Notifications:**
Access pending comments from your notification center for quick review.

### Responding to Profile Comments

When someone comments on your profile, you can:
- Reply directly to their comment (creates a conversation thread)
- Visit their profile and leave a comment in return
- Send them a direct message (if they allow DMs)

### Deleting Profile Comments

**On Your Own Profile:**
You can delete any comment left on your profile:
1. Find the comment you want to remove
2. Click the delete/remove option
3. Confirm deletion

**On Other Profiles:**
You can delete your own comments that you've left on others' profiles, but you cannot delete other people's comments (unless you're the profile owner).

### Profile Comment Notifications

You'll receive notifications when:
- Someone leaves a comment on your profile
- Someone replies to a profile comment thread you're part of
- A profile comment you left is approved or responded to

Manage notification preferences in your [アカウント設定](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/notification-settings).

### Privacy and Profile Comments

Profile Comments are great for:

- **Thanking helpful community members**

- **Building rapport with active participants**
- **Leaving testimonials or endorsements**
- **Creating a social guestbook experience**
