User Profiles in FastComments provide a dedicated space for each user to showcase their identity, activity, and contributions across your community.

### What is a User Profile?

A User Profile is a personalized page for each FastComments user that displays:

- **Profile Header** - A customizable background image that personalizes the profile
- **Avatar** - The user's profile picture with online/offline status indicator
- **Display Information** - Username, display name, and optional country flag
- **Bio** - A personal description or introduction
- **Social Links** - Connections to the user's social media profiles and website
- **Badges** - Earned achievements and recognition
- **Statistics** - User karma and total comment count
- **Communities** - Which sites/domains the user is active in

### Accessing User Profiles

There are several ways to access a user's profile:

1. **Click on an avatar** - In the comment widget, click any user's avatar to view their profile
2. **Click on a username** - Usernames in comments are clickable links to profiles
3. **Direct URL** - Visit `https://fastcomments.com/auth/user-profile/[userId]`

### Profile Views

When viewing a profile, you'll see different tabs depending on whether you're viewing your own profile or someone else's:

#### Your Own Profile
- **Notifications** - Your notifications and mentions
- **Recent Activity** - Your comment history across all communities
- **Profile Comments** - Comments others have left on your profile page
- **Direct Messages** - Private conversations with other users

#### Other Users' Profiles
- **Recent Activity** - Their public comment history (if not set to private)
- **Profile Comments** - Comments on their profile (if not set to private)
- **Direct Messages** - Start or continue a private conversation (if they allow DMs)

### Online Status

User profiles display real-time online status:
- **Green indicator** - User is currently online
- **No indicator** - User is offline

This helps you know when someone is actively using the platform, which is especially useful for direct messaging.

### User Types

FastComments supports two types of users with profiles:

1. **Regular Users** - Users who signed up directly with FastComments
2. **SSO Users** - Users who authenticate through your site's Single Sign-On integration

Both user types have access to the full profile system, though SSO users may have some restrictions on editing certain fields (like avatars) depending on your SSO configuration.
