Badges are visual achievements that appear on your User Profile, recognizing your contributions and activity across FastComments communities.

### What Are Badges?

Badges are earned recognition for various activities such as:
- Number of comments posted
- Upvotes received
- Replies generated
- Moderator actions
- Time as a community member
- Special achievements

Each badge displays on your profile and can optionally appear next to your name in comments.

### Viewing Your Badges

Your earned badges appear on your profile page in the header section. There are two categories:

1. **Earned Badges** - Badges you've fully earned and unlocked
2. **In Progress** - Badges you're working toward, with progress bars showing how close you are

### Badge Display

You have full control over how badges appear:

**On Your Profile:**
All earned badges are displayed on your profile header for others to see.

**On Your Comments:**
You can choose which badges appear next to your name when you comment:

1. Visit your profile page
2. Click "Manage Badges" or access the badge management dialog
3. Toggle which badges should appear on your comments
4. Reorder badges by dragging them to set display priority

This allows you to showcase your most meaningful achievements without cluttering your comment signature.

### Badge Types

Badges come in various types based on different achievement categories. For a complete overview of all available badge types and how to earn them, see the [Badges Guide](/guides/badges).

Common badge categories include:

- **Engagement Badges** - Based on comment count, replies, and interaction
- **Quality Badges** - Based on upvotes and community reception
- **Time-Based Badges** - Veteran status, night owl activity
- **Moderator Badges** - Recognition for moderation actions
- **Special Badges** - Manually awarded or community-specific achievements

### Community-Specific Badges

Badges can be earned across different FastComments communities:

- **Global Badges** - Earned across all FastComments usage
- **Community Badges** - Earned within specific sites/tenants

Your profile shows which community awarded each badge, helping visitors understand your areas of expertise and participation.

### Badge Progress Tracking

For badges you haven't fully earned yet, your profile shows:

- **Progress Bar** - Visual indicator of how close you are to earning the badge
- **Requirements** - What you need to do to unlock the badge
- **Community Context** - Which community the badge is associated with

This motivates continued participation and gives you clear goals to work toward.

### Customizing Badge Display

**Badge Order:**
You can reorder badges to control which appear first. The order you set determines:
- Priority in the profile display
- Which badges show in limited space situations
- Personal preference for highlighting achievements

**Visibility:**
Toggle individual badges on/off for comment display while keeping them visible on your profile.

### Manual Badges

Community administrators can award special manual badges to recognize:
- Special contributions
- Contest winners
- VIP members
- Custom achievements

These badges appear alongside automatically earned badges on your profile.
