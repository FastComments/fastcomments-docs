The Activity Feed on User Profiles displays a user's comment history, notifications, and community participation across all FastComments-powered sites.

### What is the Activity Feed?

The Activity Feed provides a chronological view of:
- Comments posted by the user
- Replies received
- Mentions and interactions
- Activity across different communities
- Real-time updates on user engagement

### Viewing Activity

**Your Own Activity:**
When viewing your profile, you'll see additional tabs:
1. **Notifications** - Alerts about replies, mentions, and interactions
2. **Recent Activity** - Your complete comment history across all sites

**Other Users' Activity:**
When viewing someone else's profile:
1. **Recent Activity** - Their public comment history (if not set to private)

The activity tab shows where and when users are participating across the FastComments network.

### Notifications Tab

Your Notifications tab displays:

**What You'll See:**

### Recent Activity Tab

The Recent Activity tab shows all comments posted by the user across FastComments communities.

**What's Displayed:**
- **Comment content** - The full text of each comment

**Activity Filtering:**
On your own profile, you can filter activity to show:

- **Replies to Me** - Only comments that are replies to your comments

This makes it easy to focus on conversations where you're directly engaged.

### Community Participation

The profile also shows which communities the user is active in:

- **Community List** - Sites/domains where the user has commented
- **Activity Distribution** - How much the user participates in each community
- **Community Links** - Clickable links to visit those sites

This helps you understand where a user is most engaged and their areas of interest.

### Statistics

User profiles display key statistics:

**Karma:**
- A reputation score based on upvotes and community reception
- Increases when your comments receive upvotes
- Decreases when comments receive downvotes
- Reflects overall community appreciation of your contributions

**Comment Count:**
- Total number of comments posted across all communities
- Includes both top-level comments and replies
- Updated in real-time as you participate

These statistics give a quick overview of a user's engagement level and community standing.

### Privacy Controls

Users can control activity visibility through privacy settings:

**Make Profile Activity Private:**
When enabled:
- Only you can see your Recent Activity tab
- Others cannot view your comment history on your profile
- Your public comments are still visible in their original context (on articles)
- Only the aggregated activity view on your profile is hidden
