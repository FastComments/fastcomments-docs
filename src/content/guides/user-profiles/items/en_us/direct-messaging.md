Direct Messaging (DM) allows FastComments users to have private, one-on-one conversations with each other, separate from public comments and profile interactions.

### What is Direct Messaging?

Direct Messaging provides:
- **Private conversations** between two users
- **Real-time messaging** with notifications
- **Conversation history** that persists across sessions
- **Online status** indicators to see when someone is available
- **Unread message tracking** to stay on top of new messages

### Starting a Direct Message

There are several ways to initiate a DM conversation:

**From a User Profile:**
1. Visit the user's profile page
2. Click the "Direct Messages" tab or "Send Message" button
3. Type your message and send

**From a Comment:**
Some implementations allow clicking on a user's name or avatar to quickly access their profile and messaging options.

**Direct Link:**
If you have a conversation ID or DM redirect link, you can access conversations directly.

### Accessing Your Messages

To view all your direct message conversations:

1. Visit your profile page
2. Click the "Direct Messages" tab
3. See a list of all your conversations

Each conversation shows:
- The other participant's avatar and name
- Their online/offline status (green indicator when online)
- A preview of the last message
- Unread message count (if any)
- Timestamp of last activity

### Conversation View

When you open a conversation, you'll see:

- **Full message history** - All messages between you and the other user
- **Real-time updates** - New messages appear instantly via WebSocket
- **Online status** - See if the other person is currently online
- **Message timestamps** - When each message was sent
- **Message composition** - Text box to type and send new messages

### Message Notifications

You'll receive notifications for new direct messages:

- **In-app notifications** - Badge counter on your profile
- **Email notifications** - Depending on your notification settings
- **Real-time alerts** - Instant notifications when you're logged in

Manage notification preferences in your [Account Settings](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/notification-settings).

### Privacy and Blocking

**Disabling Direct Messages:**
If you don't want to receive DMs, you can disable them completely:
1. Go to Privacy Settings on your profile
2. Enable "Disable Direct Messages"
3. The DM option will be hidden from your profile

For more details, see [Privacy Settings](/guides/user-profiles/privacy-settings).

**Blocking Users:**
If someone is harassing you via DM:
1. Visit their profile
2. Block the user
3. They will no longer be able to message you

Blocked users cannot:
- Send you direct messages
- See your activity
- Comment on your profile
- Interact with you anywhere on FastComments

### Managing Conversations

**Hiding Conversations:**
You can hide conversations you no longer want to see in your conversation list:
1. Open your Direct Messages tab
2. Find the conversation to hide
3. Select the hide/archive option

Hidden conversations won't appear in your main list but can be accessed if the other person sends a new message.

**Marking as Read:**
Messages are automatically marked as read when you view them. You can also manually mark entire conversations as read:
1. Open your Direct Messages tab
2. Select a conversation
3. Choose "Mark as Read"

This clears the unread counter for that conversation.

### Best Practices

**When to Use Direct Messages:**
- Asking follow-up questions privately
- Thanking someone for helpful advice
- Discussing off-topic matters without cluttering public comments
- Coordinating with other community members
- Providing private feedback or suggestions

**DM Etiquette:**
- Be respectful and professional
- Don't spam users with unsolicited messages
- Respect if someone doesn't respond or disables DMs
- Keep conversations relevant and constructive
- Don't share others' DMs without permission

**Safety Tips:**
- Don't share personal information (phone, address, etc.) unless you trust the person
- Block and report users who harass or abuse DMs
- Be cautious of suspicious links or requests
- Use the blocking feature if someone makes you uncomfortable
