User Notes allow you to keep private, personal annotations about other FastComments users. These notes are completely private and only visible to you.

### What Are User Notes?

User Notes are:
- **Private annotations** you create about other users
- **Visible only to you** - the user you're writing about cannot see them
- **Persistent** - saved and accessible whenever you view that user's profile
- **Helpful for remembering** context, interactions, or important details about users

### Why Use User Notes?

User Notes are useful for:

**Moderators:**
- Track history of interactions with specific users
- Note warning patterns or behavioral observations
- Remember context for moderation decisions
- Document why certain actions were taken

**Community Managers:**
- Remember valuable contributors and their expertise
- Note users who might be good candidates for special roles
- Track follow-ups needed with community members

**Regular Users:**
- Remember how you know someone across different communities
- Note topics you've discussed with specific users
- Keep track of helpful contributors in your areas of interest
- Remember personal details shared in conversations (within appropriate bounds)

### Creating a User Note

To add a note about a user:

1. Visit the user's profile page
2. Look for the "User Note" or "Add Note" section
3. Click to create a new note
4. Type your note (up to 1000 characters)
5. Save the note

The note will be saved and appear whenever you view that user's profile.

### Viewing User Notes

Your notes appear when viewing the associated user's profile:

- **Location:** Typically in a dedicated section on the profile page
- **Visibility:** Only visible to you when you're logged in
- **Context:** Appears alongside the user's public information

This makes it easy to remember important context about users you interact with regularly.

### Editing User Notes

To update an existing note:

1. Visit the user's profile
2. Find your existing note
3. Click "Edit" or click into the note field
4. Make your changes
5. Save the updated note

### Deleting User Notes

To remove a note:

1. Visit the user's profile
2. Find your note
3. Click "Delete" or the remove option
4. Confirm deletion

Once deleted, the note is permanently removed and cannot be recovered.

### Character Limit

User Notes are limited to **1000 characters**. This encourages:
- Concise, focused notes
- Key points rather than lengthy narratives
- Quick reference information

If you need more space, consider keeping separate documentation outside of FastComments.

### Privacy and Security

**Complete Privacy:**
- Notes are stored with your user ID
- Only you can see notes you've created
- The user you're writing about cannot see your notes
- Other users cannot see your notes
- Site administrators cannot see your personal notes (they're stored separately from moderation logs)

**Note on Moderation:**
User Notes are different from moderation notes or flags:
- Use User Notes for personal reference
- Use moderation reporting tools for violations or issues
- User Notes don't trigger any actions or alerts

### Best Practices

**What to Include:**
- How you met or know the user
- Topics they're knowledgeable about
- Previous helpful interactions
- Context from past conversations
- Areas of expertise or interest
- Reminders for follow-up

**What to Avoid:**
- Don't use notes to store sensitive personal information
- Avoid inflammatory or inappropriate content even in private notes
- Don't rely on notes for critical information (keep backups elsewhere)
- Remember notes are just for your reference, not official records

**Professional Use:**
For moderators and community managers:
- Keep notes factual and objective
- Include dates for time-sensitive information
- Note patterns rather than isolated incidents
- Use notes to supplement (not replace) official moderation logs

### Use Cases

**Example 1: Community Manager**
> "Active in tech discussions. Works as a backend developer. Has offered to help with documentation. Follow up about contributing to the wiki."

**Example 2: Moderator**
> "Helpful user but sometimes gets into heated debates. Generally respectful. Responded well to previous reminder about civility."

**Example 3: Regular User**
> "Met in gaming threads. Plays same games I do. Shared helpful tutorial link. Based in UK time zone."

### Limitations

**What User Notes Don't Do:**
- They don't sync across devices (unless you're logged into the same account)
- They don't appear in comments or other contexts, only on profiles
- They don't affect the user's profile or visibility in any way
- They aren't searchable (currently)
- They don't trigger notifications or actions

**Storage:**
- Notes are stored indefinitely unless you delete them
- Maximum 1000 characters per note
- One note per user (update the existing note rather than creating multiple)

### Technical Details

User Notes are:
- Stored in the database with your user ID as the creator
- Associated with the target user's ID
- Encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- Subject to standard FastComments data retention policies
- Not included in public data exports or API responses

### Troubleshooting

**Note Not Saving:**
- Check that you're logged in
- Ensure the note is under 1000 characters
- Try refreshing the page and adding again
- Check your internet connection

**Note Not Appearing:**
- Make sure you're logged into the account that created the note
- Refresh the user's profile page
- Clear browser cache if needed

**Accidentally Deleted Note:**
Unfortunately, deleted notes cannot be recovered. Consider keeping backups of important information outside of FastComments.
