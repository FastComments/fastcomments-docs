FastComments gives you granular control over your profile's privacy and who can interact with you. All privacy settings can be managed from your profile page's Privacy Preferences section.

### Accessing Privacy Settings

To manage your privacy settings:
1. Visit your profile page
2. Click on the "Privacy Preferences" tab or section
3. Adjust your settings as desired
4. Changes are saved automatically

### Activity Visibility

Control who can see your comment activity across FastComments communities.

**Setting:** Make Profile Activity Private

- **When disabled (default):** Anyone can view your recent comments and activity on your profile
- **When enabled:** Only you can see your comment history and activity feed

This is useful if you want to participate in discussions but prefer to keep your comment history private from other users.

### Profile Comments Visibility

Control whether others can see and leave comments on your profile page.

**Setting:** Make Profile Comments Private

- **When disabled (default):** Anyone can view and leave comments on your profile
- **When enabled:** Profile comments are hidden from others; only you can see comments left on your profile

Use this setting if you want to limit interaction on your profile page while still allowing activity elsewhere.

### Direct Messaging

Control whether other users can send you direct messages.

**Setting:** Disable Direct Messages

- **When disabled (default):** Other users can send you direct messages
- **When enabled:** The Direct Message option is hidden from your profile; users cannot initiate conversations with you

This is helpful if you prefer not to receive private messages or want to limit one-on-one conversations.

### Profile Comment Approval

Control how comments on your profile are moderated before they appear publicly.

**Setting:** Profile Comment Approval Mode

You have four options for managing profile comments:

#### 1. Auto Approve All
All comments posted to your profile are immediately visible without requiring approval.

**Best for:** Users who want an open, unrestricted profile comment section.

#### 2. Auto Approve Trusted (Default)
Comments from trusted users are automatically approved, while comments from new or untrusted users require manual approval.

**Best for:** Most users - balances openness with protection from spam or unwanted content.

**What makes a user "trusted":**
- Users with good karma
- Users with established comment history
- Users who haven't been flagged for spam or violations

#### 3. Manual Approve All
All comments require your manual approval before they appear on your profile, regardless of who posted them.

**Best for:** Users who want complete control over what appears on their profile.

**How approval works:**
- New comments are held for review
- You receive a notification when someone comments
- You can approve or reject comments via email or from your profile

#### 4. Manual Approve New
Only comments from new or untrusted users require approval. Established community members' comments are auto-approved.

**Best for:** Users who want to screen new users while allowing established community members to comment freely.

### Managing Pending Profile Comments

When comments require approval, you'll receive notifications and can manage them in several ways:

1. **Via Email:** Approve or reject directly from the notification email
2. **From Your Profile:** View pending comments in your Profile Comments tab
3. **Notification Center:** Access pending comments from your notifications

### Blocking Users

In addition to profile privacy settings, you can block specific users from interacting with you anywhere on FastComments:

- Blocked users cannot comment on your profile
- Blocked users cannot send you direct messages
- Blocked users' comments are hidden from your view
- You won't see each other's activity

To block a user, visit their profile and click the "Block User" option.
