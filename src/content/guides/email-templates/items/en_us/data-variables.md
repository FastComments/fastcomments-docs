Each template works within a different context, meaning different data is available.

A quick, at-a-glance way to see what data is available is to check the test data
provided for the template. When editing a template, click the `Test Data` tab to see
a JSON structure.

You can also customize the test data in this area to see how your template looks
in different situations. The test data can be reset to the default with the `Reset` button.
