Each template works within a different context, meaning different data is available.

A quick at-a-glance way to see what data is available is to check the test data
provided for the template. When editing a template, click the `Test Data` tab to see
a JSON structure.

We can also customize the test data in this area, to see how our template looks
in different situations. The test data can be reset back to the default with the `Reset` button.

#### Note!

We plan to add auto complete in the editor in the near future. This will assist in creating
accurate templates.
