The admin area for creating templates can be found by going to [Customize -> Email Templates](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/customize-email-templates).

Here you will see a list of the different types of emails sent by the platform, with a description
for each template describing when it is used.

For example, we can customize the `Commenter Comment Notification` email, which is `Sent when a commenter has a reply to their comment`.

Clicking `Create Template` will not immediately apply changes. You may open the editor
for the default template and play around with the preview, and there will be no effect
until you hit `Save`.
