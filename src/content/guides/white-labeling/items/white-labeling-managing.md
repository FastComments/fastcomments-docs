Managed tenants can be administered via the admin dashboard by going to [My Account -> Tenants](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/impersonate).

All actions performed against a managed tenant are done via what FastComments calls `Impersonation`. Impersonate a tenant to add users, moderators, moderate comments,
get API keys and more. This is also how a tenant would be deleted and so on.
