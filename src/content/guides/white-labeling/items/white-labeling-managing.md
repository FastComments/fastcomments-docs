Managed tenants can be administered via the admin dashboard by going to [My Account -> Tenants](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/tenants).

All actions performed against a managed tenant are done via switching to that tenant. Switch to a tenant to add users, moderators, moderate comments,
get API keys and more. You can also impersonate users of a tenant to see things how they would.
