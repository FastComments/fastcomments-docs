The easiest way to get started with white labeling is using the admin dashboard, where tenants can be
added and managed.

Simply go to [My Account -> Tenants](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/impersonate) and click `Create Tenant` at the bottom.

You'll be asked some basic information, like the desired default admin's username and email, and what the name of the tenant should be, as well as what sites
FastComments will be used on for this tenant.

Additionally, you'll be able to set limits for what the tenant can do with the platform.
