The process for setting up White Labeling is as follows:

1. Choose how billing will be handled.
   1. With FastComments Pro, you pay a fixed amount for up to a certain number of white labeled tenants.
   2. With FastComments Flex, you pay for each tenant and the usage of that tenant.
   3. You set the limits of each tenant in both cases.
      1. Limits can be customized on a per-tenant basis. Additionally, if you update the packages that you sell, you can do so without disrupting the pricing you've already provided to existing customers.
2. Become familiar with the FastComments.com terminology:
   1. `Tenant` is a "customer".
   2. `TenantUser` is an administrator with a set of privileges in the `Tenant`.
   3. `TenantPackage` is a package with set of limits and pricing available to a `Tenant`.
3. Integrate with our [API](/guide-api.html) or use [scripts](https://github.com/FastComments/fastcomments-code-examples/tree/master/white-labeling) to on-board tenants.
