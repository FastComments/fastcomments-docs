The easiest way to get started with white-labeling is to use the admin dashboard, where tenants can be added and managed.

Simply go to [My Account -> Tenants](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/tenants) and click `Create Tenant` at the bottom.

You'll be asked for some basic information, like what the name of the tenant should be, as well as which sites
FastComments will be used on for this tenant.

Additionally, you'll be able to set limits on what the tenant can do with the platform.
