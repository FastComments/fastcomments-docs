Managed tenants can be administered from the admin dashboard by going to [My Account -> Tenants](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/tenants).

All actions performed on a managed tenant are done by switching to that tenant. Switch to a tenant to add users, moderators, moderate comments, get API keys, and more. You can also impersonate users of a tenant to see things as they would.
