FastComments shows progression on via badges in a number of ways.

For the following examples we'll have the badges setup:

1. New User (Comment Count Badge with threshold = 1)
2. Newbie (Comment Count Badge with threshold = 10)
3. Top Member (Comment Count Badge with threshold = 100)

### Badge Stacking

Stacking is the default badge behavior. When a user earns a new badge, it simply gets added onto their profile and displayed
on all their comments. Up to 15 badges are displayed.

### Replacing Badges

Badges can be configured to replace other badges. When editing a badge, you can select which badge the new badge replaces.

We can configure `Newbie` to replace `New User` and `Top Member` to replace `Newbie`. This way, the previous badge
is automatically hidden and the new shiny badge is shown. All versions still remain in the user's account. They can always
hide the `Top Member` badge if they want and show the `Newbie` badge.

### Checking Progress

A user can see the progress of earning a badge on their profile. It will show, at the top of their profile, how far along they are
for earning a badge (for example, how many comments they left and how many they need to leave, or how long they've been a member, etc).
