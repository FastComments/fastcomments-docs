Manual badges are badges which are never automatically awarded. Administrators and moderators can award this badge by
selecting the `Award Badge` option in the comment menu which will award the badge to the user and display it on all their comments, or
by opening the user's profile by clicking their avatar, and in the top right menu clicking `Manage Badges`.
