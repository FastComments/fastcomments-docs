The `Fast Reply Time` badge progress is earned when a user quickly replies to another user. This can be used to encourage members
of your community to quickly help other members, among other things. Only approved comments count.

To count progress toward this badge, the reply must be within 40 seconds of the parent (FastComments is live, after all!). This is not currently configurable
today but may be via support request.

Note: Removing comments will not remove progress toward this badge.
