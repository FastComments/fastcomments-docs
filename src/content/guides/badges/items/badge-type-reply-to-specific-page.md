The `Reply to Specific Page` badge can be configured to be awarded when a user comments on a particular page. For example, if you have
an `FAQ` page, you might want to award users for answering questions here. It is based on a configurable threshold, for example you
may only want to award this badge after they leave 10 comments on said page.
