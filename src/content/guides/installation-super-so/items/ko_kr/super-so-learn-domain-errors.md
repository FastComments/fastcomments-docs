You may get an authorization error, like the following:

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">도메인 구성 누락</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/installation-guide-webflow-step-5.png" alt="도메인 구성 누락" />
</div>

This is because FastComments doesn't know it's supposed to allow your account to be used on this domain.

In this case, the fix is simple. You just have to add your site to your FastComments.com account.
