With FastComments SSO Access Control, users can be restricted to only access certain pages, or comment threads.

Users also cannot tag users in other groups.

#### In Detail

`Users` can be placed into groups, in which case they will only be able to access `Pages` where
there is an intersection of said groups.

For example, if `User A` belongs to group `GREEN`, they will only be able to see `Pages` that
include group `GREEN`.

Additionally, if `User B` belongs to group `BLUE`, then neither user will be able to `@mention` each other.
