First, note that this tutorial only applies for the Hostinger Website Builder.

If you're using Hostinger with WordPress, you can just install our [WordPress Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fastcomments/)
which has its [own instructions](https://docs.fastcomments.com/guide-installation-wordpress.html).

This tutorial will continue with instructions for the Website Builder.
