SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an XML-based open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, 
particularly between an identity provider (IdP) and a service provider (SP).

### How SAML Works

SAML enables single sign-on (SSO) by allowing users to authenticate once with their identity provider and then access multiple applications 
without re-entering credentials. When a user attempts to access FastComments:

1. **Authentication Request**: FastComments redirects the user to your identity provider
2. **User Authentication**: The user authenticates with your IdP (e.g., Active Directory, Okta, Azure AD)
3. **SAML Response**: The IdP sends a signed SAML assertion back to FastComments
4. **User Access**: FastComments validates the assertion and grants access to the authenticated user

### Benefits of SAML

- **Enhanced Security**: Centralized authentication reduces password-related security risks
- **Improved User Experience**: Users sign in once and access multiple applications seamlessly
- **Compliance**: Helps meet regulatory requirements for access control and audit trails
- **Administrative Control**: IT administrators maintain centralized user management

### SAML 2.0 Support

FastComments implements SAML 2.0, the most widely adopted version of the SAML standard. Our implementation supports:

- HTTP-POST and HTTP-Redirect bindings
- Signed SAML responses and assertions
- Encrypted assertions (optional)
- Multiple signature and digest algorithms
- Various name identifier formats
