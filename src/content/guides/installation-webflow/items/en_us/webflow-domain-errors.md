You may get an authorization error, like the following:

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Domain Configuration Missing</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/installation-guide-webflow-step-5.png" alt="Domain Configuration Missing" />
</div>

This happens because FastComments doesn't know it should allow your account to be used on this domain.

In this case, the fix is simple: just add your site to your FastComments.com account.

[Go here to add your site to your account.](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/configure-domains)

Add the domain as shown below:

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Add Your Domain</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/installation-guide-webflow-step-6.png" alt="Add Your Domain" />
</div>

Now you should have fast, live commenting added to your Webflow site!
