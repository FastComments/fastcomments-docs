Next, let's copy our FastComments.com widget code:

[code-example-start config = {}; title = 'Installation Code'; isFunctional = false; code-example-end]

This code is for the Live Commenting widget. The code for other widgets can be found [here](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/widgets).

Now we can paste this code in the Embed Block:

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Step Two: Paste Your FastComments.com Code</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/installation-guide-webflow-step-2.png" alt="Paste Your FastComments.com Code" />
</div>

After adding the code, Webflow will inform you that the widget will not show in Edit or Preview mode. This is normal.

<div class="screenshot white-bg">
    <div class="title">Note: Comments Will Not Appear Until Publish</div>
    <img class="screenshot-image" src="/images/installation-guides/installation-guide-webflow-step-3.png" alt="Comments Will Not Appear Until Publish" />
</div>
