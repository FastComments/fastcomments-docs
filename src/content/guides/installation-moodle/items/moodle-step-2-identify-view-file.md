Next we need to identify the `view.php`. This will probably be in a directory like `/var/www/html/moodle/mod/book/view.php`.

Once you find this file, let's back it up before moving on: `sudo cp /var/www/html/moodle/mod/book/view.php /var/www/html/moodle/mod/book/view.php.bak`.

If your site breaks during this tutorial, we can restore it via the command: `sudo cp /var/www/html/moodle/mod/book/view.php.bak /var/www/html/moodle/mod/book/view.php`.
