The plugin adds a FastComments section to each user's Moodle profile preferences. Users can manage their notification settings without visiting the FastComments website.

#### Available Preferences

- **Reply Notifications** - receive notifications when someone replies to their comments.
- **Subscription Notifications** - receive notifications for threads they are subscribed to.

Users can access these settings from their Moodle profile under the FastComments section.
