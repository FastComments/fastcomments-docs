## Developing Extensions

### Context

FastComments provides the ability to extend our core functionality via scripts we call Extensions.

An `Extension` can add additional markup to the comment widget, event listeners, and run arbitrary code.

Here you will find examples of extensions we have in production, as well as documentation on how to write extensions.
