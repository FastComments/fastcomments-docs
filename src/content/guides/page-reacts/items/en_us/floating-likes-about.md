The floating likes widget displays a floating box in the bottom-right corner of the screen showing like and comment counts. You can see it in action on this page!

Users can click the heart to like the page, and it remembers pages they've liked. If they are logged into fastcomments.com, this is tied to their
account to help prevent users from liking a page multiple times.

It also automatically detects the user's browser dark mode preferences and switches its skin to a dark version when preferred.
