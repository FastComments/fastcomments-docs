FastComments supports multiple types of per-page reactions. We support what we call "Page Reacts" (demoed at bottom of this page) which are customizable emojis, or icons, that can display
above the comment area.

We also have the Floating Likes widget which appears in the bottom right of the screen. This documentation covers both.
