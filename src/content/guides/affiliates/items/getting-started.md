To get started, you must create a FastComments account on FastComments.com.

If you'd like to also host FastComments on your own sites, then you would want to [sign up here](https://fastcomments.com/traffic-pricing).

Otherwise, you can create a regular "commenter" account. You can do this by leaving your desired username and email on the [login page](https://fastcomments.com/auth/login).

This will create a commenter account for you. You can use this account to comment with FastComments and also set up the Affiliates
program via the Affiliates nav item.
