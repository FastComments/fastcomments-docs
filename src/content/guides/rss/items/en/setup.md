Navigate to your account dashboard and go to the [RSS Feed page](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/rss).

[app-screenshot-start url='/auth/my-account/rss'; selector = '.content'; title='RSS Feed Configuration' app-screenshot-end]

On the RSS Feed page, check the "Enable RSS Feed Access" checkbox to generate your unique RSS feed URL.

When you enable the feed, a security notice will appear explaining that anyone with the link can access your comments.

Once enabled, your unique RSS feed URL will appear. Click the "Copy" button to copy the URL to your clipboard.

Open your RSS reader application and add the copied URL as a new feed subscription. The exact steps vary by RSS reader, but typically you'll look for an "Add Feed" or "Subscribe" button, paste your RSS feed URL, and give the feed a name.

You can also click the "View Feed" button on the RSS Feed page to see your feed directly in your browser.

To disable access to your RSS feed, simply uncheck the "Enable RSS Feed Access" checkbox. This will prevent the feed from being accessed, though the URL will remain the same if you re-enable it later.
