RSS feeds in FastComments are secured using unique, non-guessable UUIDs. However, when you enable your RSS feed, anyone who has the URL can access your comments.

The feed is not password-protected, so the URL should be treated as sensitive information and shared only with trusted RSS readers or services.

Best practices:

- **Keep Your URL Private**: Don't share your RSS feed URL publicly or in locations where unauthorized users might find it.
- **Use Trusted RSS Readers**: Only add your feed to RSS reader services you trust, as they will have access to your comment data.
- **Monitor Access**: If you suspect your feed URL has been compromised, you can disable and re-enable the feed to generate a new URL.
- **Disable When Not Needed**: If you're no longer using the RSS feed, disable it in your dashboard to prevent any access.

The RSS feed contains comment text and HTML content, commenter names, comment dates, links to the pages where comments were made, and vote counts.

The feed does **not** contain commenter email addresses, IP addresses, or other sensitive user information.
