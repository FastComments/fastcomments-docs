### What is GDPR?

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data privacy law that came into effect in the European Union in May 2018. It establishes strict requirements for how organizations collect, store, process, and protect personal data of EU residents.

### Who Does GDPR Apply To?

GDPR applies to:

- Any organization operating within the EU that processes personal data
- Any organization outside the EU that offers goods or services to EU residents
- Any organization that monitors the behavior of EU residents

If your website or service has users in the EU, GDPR compliance is essential.

### Key GDPR Requirements

GDPR requires organizations to:

- **Process data lawfully and transparently** - Users must know how their data is being used
- **Collect data only for specific purposes** - Data collection must be limited to what's necessary
- **Store data securely** - Appropriate technical and organizational security measures must be in place
- **Respect user rights** - Users have rights to access, correct, delete, and export their data
- **Keep data within appropriate jurisdictions** - Cross-border data transfers must meet specific requirements
