### GDPR Compliance Best Practices

This section provides recommendations for maintaining GDPR compliance when using FastComments on your website or application.

### Choosing the Right Region

#### When to Use EU Region

Use the **EU region** (eu.fastcomments.com) if:

- **Your primary users are in the EU** - Most of your commenters are EU residents
- **You have data residency requirements** - Legal or contractual obligations to keep EU data in the EU
- **You want to simplify compliance** - Keeping data in the EU reduces complexity for GDPR compliance
- **Your privacy policy commits to EU storage** - You've promised users their data stays in the EU
- **You serve only EU users** - Your website or service is exclusively for EU audiences

#### When Standard Region May Be Appropriate

The standard region may be suitable if:

- Your user base is primarily outside the EU
- You have appropriate safeguards for international data transfers
- You've completed a Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA)
- You rely on Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or other transfer mechanisms

**Note:** Even with the standard region, FastComments provides the same GDPR-compliant features for user rights and data protection. The primary difference is data center location.

### Privacy Policy Requirements

#### What to Include

Your privacy policy should clearly explain:

1. **What data is collected** - Comment text, names, email addresses, IP addresses
2. **Why data is collected** - Purpose of each type of data collection
3. **How data is processed** - Use of FastComments as a comment platform
4. **Where data is stored** - EU data centers (if using EU region) or standard data centers
5. **How long data is retained** - Your retention policies
6. **Third-party processors** - FastComments as a data processor
7. **User rights** - How users can access, correct, delete, or export their data
8. **Contact information** - How users can reach you with privacy questions

#### Example Privacy Policy Language

```
Comments:
When you leave a comment on our site, we collect the data shown in the
comment form, your IP address, and browser user agent string to help
with spam detection. Comments are processed by FastComments, our
comment platform provider. [For EU region customers: All comment data
is stored exclusively in European Union data centers.]

You can request deletion of your comments at any time by [describe process].
You can request an export of your comment data by [describe process].
```

### Data Processing Agreement

#### FastComments as a Processor

Under GDPR, FastComments acts as a **data processor** for your organization (the **data controller**) when providing commenting services.

**What this means:**
- You determine the purposes and means of processing personal data
- FastComments processes data on your behalf according to your instructions
- A Data Processing Agreement (DPA) is required

#### Obtaining a DPA

To obtain a Data Processing Agreement with FastComments:

1. Contact FastComments support
2. Review the DPA terms
3. Execute the agreement
4. Keep a copy for your compliance records

### Legal Basis for Processing

#### Identifying Your Legal Basis

Under GDPR, you must have a legal basis for processing personal data. Common bases for comment processing:

**Legitimate Interest (Article 6(1)(f)):**
- Most common for comment functionality
- Your legitimate interest in enabling community discussion
- Must balance against user privacy rights
- Document your legitimate interest assessment

**Consent (Article 6(1)(a)):**
- User explicitly agrees to comment submission
- Must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous
- Users can withdraw consent at any time

**Contract (Article 6(1)(b)):**
- May apply if commenting is part of a service contract with users

#### Documenting Your Legal Basis

In your privacy policy and internal documentation:

1. State which legal basis you rely on
2. Explain why processing is necessary for that purpose
3. If using legitimate interest, document your balancing test
4. Be prepared to demonstrate compliance to regulators

### User Rights Implementation

#### Create Clear Processes

Establish documented procedures for:

1. **Access requests** - How users can request copies of their data
2. **Rectification** - How users can correct their data
3. **Erasure** - How users can delete their accounts and comments
4. **Data portability** - How users can export their data
5. **Objection** - How users can object to processing

#### Response Templates

Prepare standard response templates for:

- Acknowledging receipt of requests
- Requesting additional information for verification
- Delivering requested data
- Confirming deletion
- Explaining any limitations or exceptions

#### Staff Training

Ensure your team knows:

- How to recognize user rights requests
- Verification procedures
- Where to find user data in FastComments
- How to use FastComments API for data export/deletion
- One-month response deadline
- When to escalate to legal/compliance

### Data Retention Policies

#### Establish Clear Retention Periods

Define how long you keep different types of data:

**Active Comments:**
- Keep as long as the page/content exists, or
- Set a maximum retention period (e.g., 5 years)

**Deleted Comments:**
- Immediate deletion, or
- Soft delete with purge after 30 days (for recovery)

**User Accounts:**
- Keep while account is active
- Delete 30 days after account closure request

**IP Addresses:**
- Retain for spam prevention (e.g., 90 days)
- Anonymize or delete after retention period

**Logs and Backups:**
- Define retention for system logs
- Ensure backups don't retain data beyond stated periods

#### Documenting Retention

In your privacy policy:
```
We retain comment data for [X period] or until the commented content
is removed from our site. IP addresses are retained for [Y period] for
spam prevention purposes. You can request deletion of your data at any
time.
```

### Security Measures

#### Technical Measures

Implement appropriate security:

1. **HTTPS/TLS** - Encrypt data in transit
2. **Access controls** - Limit who can access user data
3. **API security** - Secure your FastComments API credentials
4. **Regular updates** - Keep FastComments integration up to date
5. **Monitoring** - Watch for unusual activity or data breaches

#### Organizational Measures

Establish internal processes:

1. **Access policies** - Who can access personal data and why
2. **Training** - Educate staff on GDPR and data protection
3. **Incident response** - Plan for potential data breaches
4. **Vendor management** - Review FastComments security practices
5. **Documentation** - Maintain records of processing activities

### Data Breach Procedures

#### Preparation

Be prepared for potential data breaches:

1. **Incident response plan** - Document steps to take
2. **Contact information** - Know how to reach FastComments support urgently
3. **Notification templates** - Prepare draft notifications for users and regulators
4. **Assessment criteria** - Know when a breach must be reported

#### GDPR Breach Notification Requirements

If a breach occurs:

- **Notify supervisory authority** - Within 72 hours of becoming aware (if high risk)

#### Coordinating with FastComments

If a breach involves FastComments:

1. FastComments will notify you promptly
2. Cooperate with FastComments investigation
3. Determine if user notification is required
4. Document your response and rationale

### Consent Management Best Practices

#### Obtaining Consent

When using consent as your legal basis:

**Before enabling comments:**
- Explain what data will be collected
- Explain how data will be used
- Get clear affirmative action (checkbox, button click)
- Don't use pre-checked boxes
- Make consent separate from other terms acceptance

**Example:**
```
[ ] I agree to have my comment and associated data processed according
    to the [Privacy Policy]. I understand I can delete my comment at
    any time.
```

#### Recording Consent

Maintain records of:
- When consent was obtained
- What the user was told
- What they consented to
- How consent was given
- Any consent withdrawals

### Cross-Border Data Transfers

#### If Using Standard Region

If you use the standard FastComments region (not EU region), and you transfer EU user data internationally:

1. **Identify transfers** - Know where data goes
2. **Choose transfer mechanism:**
   - Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)
   - Adequacy decisions
   - Other approved mechanisms
3. **Conduct Transfer Impact Assessment** - Evaluate risks
4. **Implement supplementary measures** - Additional safeguards if needed
5. **Document everything** - Maintain transfer records

#### EU Region Simplifies Compliance

Using the EU region eliminates cross-border transfer concerns:
- Data stays in the EU
- No transfer mechanisms needed
- Simpler compliance documentation
- Reduced risk
