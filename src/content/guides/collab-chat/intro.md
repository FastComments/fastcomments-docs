## Add Inline Live Comments To Documents, Books, Etc

FastComments Collab Chat enables users to highlight and annotate any text content on your website, creating threaded discussions tied to specific text selections. Users can select words, sentences, or entire paragraphs to start collaborative conversations directly within your content.

This feature is perfect for editorial feedback, collaborative reading environments, educational platforms, document review, and any scenario where you want contextual discussions anchored to specific text.

Note that these docs are specific to the **Collab Chat** functionality. You can add commenting for content with lots of pages, like Books, with
thread-per-page, **without using collab chat**. FastComments also does not charge per-page or per-thread. Collab Chat is specifically when you
want to allow users to select text and comment on the highlighted section of text.

You can see [an example here](https://fastcomments.com/product/collab-chat).
