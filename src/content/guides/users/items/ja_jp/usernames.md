With FastComments, `username` must be unique across all sites and communities. This is because it used to log you in to fastcomments.com.

The exception is SSO - since SSO users are tied to a specific FastComments.com Tenant - they can have any username within that community.

#### 表示名

FastComments also supports `Display Name`. Display names do not have to be unique, and may contain emojis. You can set your display name
on the [アカウントの詳細](https://fastcomments.com/auth/my-account/edit-details) page.

#### 表示名の一意性

If two FastComments.com users, on two very different major communities both have similar names, then we'd like
them to just be able to set their preferred display name. However, we can't restrict where people comment with their global FastComments account, so sometimes this may
result in confusion.

Having a similar name to another user, or a moderator, by itself is not a case for abuse. However, if you abuse this by intentionally impersonating other users, we may
disable this feature on your account, and you will be limited to just using `username`.
